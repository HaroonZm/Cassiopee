Problem Statement
There are
N
cities numbered
1
to
N
, connected by
M
railroads.
You are now at City
1
, with
10^{100}
gold coins and
S
silver coins in your pocket.
The
i
-th railroad connects City
U_i
and City
V_i
bidirectionally, and a one-way trip costs
A_i
silver coins and takes
B_i
minutes.
You cannot use gold coins to pay the fare.
There is an exchange counter in each city. At the exchange counter in City
i
, you can get
C_i
silver coins for
1
gold coin.
The transaction takes
D_i
minutes for each gold coin you give.
You can exchange any number of gold coins at each exchange counter.
For each
t=2, ..., N
, find the minimum time needed to travel from City
1
to City
t
. You can ignore the time spent waiting for trains.
Constraints
2 \leq N \leq 50
N-1 \leq M \leq 100
0 \leq S \leq 10^9
1 \leq A_i \leq 50
1 \leq B_i,C_i,D_i \leq 10^9
1 \leq U_i < V_i \leq N
There is no pair
i, j(i \neq j)
such that
(U_i,V_i)=(U_j,V_j)
.
Each city
t=2,...,N
can be reached from City
1
with some number of railroads.
All values in input are integers.
