Problem Statement
Print a sequence
a_1, a_2, ..., a_N
whose length is
N
that satisfies the following conditions:
a_i
(1 \leq i \leq N)
is a prime number at most
55
555
.
The values of
a_1, a_2, ..., a_N
are all different.
In every choice of five different integers from
a_1, a_2, ..., a_N
, the sum of those integers is a composite number.
If there are multiple such sequences, printing any of them is accepted.
Notes
An integer
N
not less than
2
is called a prime number if it cannot be divided evenly by any integers except
1
and
N
, and called a composite number otherwise.
Constraints
N
is an integer between
5
and
55
(inclusive).
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
Output
Print
N
numbers
a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N
in a line, with spaces in between.
Sample Input 1
5
Sample Output 1
3 5 7 11 31
Let us see if this output actually satisfies the conditions.
First,
3
,
5
,
7
,
11
and
31
are all different, and all of them are prime numbers.
The only way to choose five among them is to choose all of them, whose sum is
a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5=57
, which is a composite number.
There are also other possible outputs, such as
2 3 5 7 13
,
11 13 17 19 31
and
7 11 5 31 3
.
Sample Input 2
6
Sample Output 2
2 3 5 7 11 13
2
,
3
,
5
,
7
,
11
,
13
are all different prime numbers.
2+3+5+7+11=28
is a composite number.
2+3+5+7+13=30
is a composite number.
2+3+5+11+13=34
is a composite number.
2+3+7+11+13=36
is a composite number.
2+5+7+11+13=38
is a composite number.
3+5+7+11+13=39
is a composite number.
Thus, the sequence
2 3 5 7 11 13
satisfies the conditions.
Sample Input 3

Sample Output 3
2 5 7 13 19 37 67 79


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
from math import *
n = int(input())
ps = set(range(2, 55556))
for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(55555) + 1)):
    if i in ps:
        k = 2
        while(i*k <= 55555):
            if i*k in ps:
                ps.remove(i*k)
            k += 1
ans = []
i = max(ps)
while len(ans) < n and i <= 55555:
    if i in ps:
        ans.append(i)
    i -= 25
print(*ans)
