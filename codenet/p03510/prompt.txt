Problem Statement
In a long narrow forest stretching east-west, there are
N
beasts. Below, we will call the point that is
p
meters from the west end Point
p
. The
i
-th beast from the west
(1 ≤ i ≤ N)
is at Point
x_i
, and can be sold for
s_i
yen (the currency of Japan) if captured.
You will choose two integers
L
and
R
(L ≤ R)
, and throw a net to cover the range from Point
L
to Point
R
including both ends,
[L, R]
. Then, all the beasts in the range will be captured. However, the net costs
R - L
yen and your profit will be
(
the sum of
s_i
over all captured beasts
i) - (R - L)
yen.
What is the maximum profit that can be earned by throwing a net only once?
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5
1 ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N ≤ 10^{15}
1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9

Output
When the maximum profit is
X
yen, print the value of
X
.

Sample Output 1
90
If you throw a net covering the range
[L = 40, R = 70]
, the second, third and fourth beasts from the west will be captured, generating the profit of
s_2 + s_3 + s_4 - (R - L) = 90
yen. It is not possible to earn
91
yen or more.

The positions of the beasts are the same as Sample 1, but the selling prices dropped significantly, so you should not aim for two or more beasts. By throwing a net covering the range
[L = 40, R = 40]
, you can earn
s_2 - (R - L) = 5
yen, and this is the maximum possible profit.
