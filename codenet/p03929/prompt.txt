Problem Statement
Snuke has a very long calendar. It has a grid with $n$ rows and $7$ columns. One day, he noticed that calendar has a following regularity.
The cell at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column contains the integer $7i+j-7$.
A good sub-grid is a $3 \times 3$ sub-grid and the sum of integers in this sub-grid mod $11$ is $k$.
How many good sub-grid are there? Write a program and help him.
Input
The input is given from standard input in the following format.
$n \quad k$
Output
Print the number of good sub-grid. If there are no solution exists, print
0
.
Constraints
$1 \le n \le 10^9$
$0 \le k \le 10$
Subtasks
Subtask 1 [ $150$ points ]
The testcase in the subtask satisfies $1 \le n \le 100$.
Subtask 2 [ $100$ points ]
There are no additional constraints.
Sample Input 1

The cell at $i$-th row and $j$-th column is denoted $(i, j)$.
If upper-left is $(1, 5)$, the sum of integers is $5+6+7+12+13+14+19+20+21=117$.
If upper-left is $(3, 2)$, the sum of integers is $16+17+18+23+24+25+30+31+32=216$.
Therefore, there are 2 good sub-grids.
Sample Input 2
6 0
Sample Output 2

If upper-left is $(1, 3)$ or $(4, 4)$, it is a good sub-grid.
Sample Input 3
