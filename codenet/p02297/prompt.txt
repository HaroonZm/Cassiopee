Voici un énoncé de problème :

Area
For a given polygon
g
, computes the area of the polygon.
g
is represented by a sequence of points
p
1
,
p
2
,...,
p
n
where line segments connecting
p
i
and
p
i+1
(1 ≤
i
≤
n-1
) are sides of
g
. The line segment connecting
p
n
and
p
1
is also a side of the polygon.
Note that the polygon is not necessarily convex.
Input
The input consists of coordinates of the points
p
1
,...,
p
n
in the following format:
n
x
1
y
1
x
2
y
2
:
x
n
y
n
The first integer
n
is the number of points. The coordinate of a point
p
i
is given by two integers
x
i
and
y
i
. The coordinates of points are given in the order of counter-clockwise visit of them.
Output
Print the area of the polygon in a line. The area should be printed with one digit to the right of the decimal point.
Constraints
3 ≤
n
≤ 100
-10000 ≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤ 10000
No point will occur more than once.
Two sides can intersect only at a common endpoint.
