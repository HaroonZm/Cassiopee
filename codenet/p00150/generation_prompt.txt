Twin Prime
Prime numbers are widely applied for cryptographic and communication technology.
A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by 2.
For example, (5, 7) and (11, 13) are twin prime pairs.
In this problem, we call the greater number of a twin prime "size of the twin prime."
Your task is to create a program which reads an integer
n
and prints a twin prime which has the maximum size among twin primes less than or equals to
n
You may assume that 5 ≤
n
≤ 10000.
Input
The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing one zero. Each dataset is formatted as follows:
n
(integer)
Output
For each dataset, print the twin prime
p
and
q
(
p
<
q
).
p
and
q
should be separated by a single space.
Sample Input
12
100
200
300
0
Output for the Sample Input
5 7
71 73
197 199
281 283
