Problem Statement
There is an undirected connected graph with $N$ vertices and $N-1$ edges. The
i
-th edge connects
u_i
and
v_i
.
E869120 the coder moves in the graph as follows:
He move to adjacent vertex, but he can't a visit vertex two or more times.
He ends move when there is no way to move.
Otherwise, he moves randomly. (equal probability) If he has $p$ way to move this turn, he choose each vertex with $1/p$ probability.
Calculate the expected value of the number of turns, when E869120 starts from vertex
i
, for all
i (1 ≤ i ≤ N)
.
Input
The input is given from standard input in the following format.
N
u_1
v_1
u_2
v_2
:
u_{N-1}
v_{N-1}
Output
In
i
-th
(1 ≤ i ≤ N)
line, print the expected vaule of the number of turns E869120 moves.
The relative error or absolute error of output should be within
10^{-6}
.
Constraints
$1 \le N \le 150,000$
The graph is connected.
Subtasks
Subtask 1 [ $190$ points ]
There is no vertex which degree is more than 2.
This means the graph looks like a list.
Subtask 2 [ $220$ points ]
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
.
Subtask 3 [ $390$ points ]
There are no additional constraints.
