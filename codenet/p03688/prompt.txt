Problem Statement
There are
N
cats.
We number them from
1
through
N
.
Each of the cats wears a hat.
Cat
i
says: "there are exactly
a_i
different colors among the
N - 1
hats worn by the cats except me."
Determine whether there exists a sequence of colors of the hats that is consistent with the remarks of the cats.
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ a_i ≤ N-1
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1
a_2
...
a_N
Output
Print
Yes
if there exists a sequence of colors of the hats that is consistent with the remarks of the cats; print
No
otherwise.
Sample Input 1

1 2 2
Sample Output 1
Yes
For example, if cat
1
,
2
and
3
wears red, blue and blue hats, respectively, it is consistent with the remarks of the cats.
Sample Input 2
3
1 1 2
Sample Output 2
No
From the remark of cat
1
, we can see that cat
2
and
3
wear hats of the same color.
Also, from the remark of cat
2
, we can see that cat
1
and
3
wear hats of the same color.
Therefore, cat
1
and
2
wear hats of the same color, which contradicts the remark of cat
3
.
