Problem Statement
You are given an integer sequence of length
N
,
a =
{
a_1, a_2, …, a_N
}, and an integer
K
.
a
has
N(N+1)/2
non-empty contiguous subsequences, {
a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_r
}
(1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N)
. Among them, how many have an arithmetic mean that is greater than or equal to
K
?
Constraints
All input values are integers.
1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \times 10^5
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
K
a_1
a_2
:
a_N
Output
Print the number of the non-empty contiguous subsequences with an arithmetic mean that is greater than or equal to
K
.

All the non-empty contiguous subsequences of
a
are listed below:
{
a_1
} = {
7
}
{
a_1, a_2
} = {
7, 5
}
{
a_1, a_2, a_3
} = {
7, 5, 7
}
{
a_2
} = {
5
}
{
a_2, a_3
} = {
5, 7
}
{
a_3
} = {
7
}
Their means are
7
,
6
,
19/3
,
5
,
6
and
7
, respectively, and five among them are
6
or greater. Note that {
a_1
} and {
a_3
} are indistinguishable by the values of their elements, but we count them individually.
