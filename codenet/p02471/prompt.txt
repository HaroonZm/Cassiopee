Extended Euclid Algorithm
Given positive integers
a
and
b
, find the integer solution (
x
,
y
) to
ax + by = gcd(a, b)
, where
gcd(a, b)
is the greatest common divisor of
a
and
b
.
Input
a
b
Two positive integers
a
and
b
are given separated by a space in a line.
Output
Print two integers
x
and
y
separated by a space. If there are several pairs of such
x
and
y
, print that pair for which
|x| + |y|
is the minimal (primarily) and
x
≤
y
(secondarily).
Constraints
1 ≤
a
,
b
≤ 10
