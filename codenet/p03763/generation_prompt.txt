Problem Statement
Snuke loves "paper cutting": he cuts out characters from a newspaper headline and rearranges them to form another string.
He will receive a headline which contains one of the strings
S_1,...,S_n
tomorrow.
He is excited and already thinking of what string he will create.
Since he does not know the string on the headline yet, he is interested in strings that can be created regardless of which string the headline contains.
Find the longest string that can be created regardless of which string among
S_1,...,S_n
the headline contains.
If there are multiple such strings, find the lexicographically smallest one among them.
Constraints
1 \leq n \leq 50
1 \leq |S_i| \leq 50
for every
i = 1, ..., n
.
S_i
consists of lowercase English letters (
a
-
z
) for every
i = 1, ..., n
.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
S_1
...
S_n
Output
Print the lexicographically smallest string among the longest strings that satisfy the condition.
If the answer is an empty string, print an empty line.
Sample Input 1
3
cbaa
daacc
acacac
Sample Output 1
aac
The strings that can be created from each of
cbaa
,
daacc
and
acacac
, are
aa
,
aac
,
aca
,
caa
and so forth.
Among them,
aac
,
aca
and
caa
are the longest, and the lexicographically smallest of these three is
aac
.
Sample Input 2
3
a
aa
b
Sample Output 2
The answer is an empty string.
