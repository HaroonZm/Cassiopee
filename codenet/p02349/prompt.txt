Range Add Query (RAQ)
Write a program which manipulates a sequence
A
= {
a
1
, a
2
, . . . , a
n
} with the following operations:
add(s, t, x)
: add
x
to
a
s
,
a
s+1
, ...,
a
t
.
get(i)
: output the value of
a
i
.
Note that the initial values of
a
i
(
i = 1, 2, . . . , n
) are 0.
Input
n
q
query
1
query
2
:
query
q
In the first line,
n
(the number of elements in
A
) and
q
(the number of queries) are given. Then,
i
th query
query
i
is given in the following format:
0
s
t
x
or
1
t
The first digit represents the type of the query. '0' denotes
add(s, t, x)
and '1' denotes
get(i)
.
Output
For each
get
operation, print the value.
Constraints

1 ≤ q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ n
1 ≤ i ≤ n
0 ≤ x ≤ 1000
