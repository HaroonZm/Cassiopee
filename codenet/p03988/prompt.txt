Problem Statement
Aoki loves numerical sequences and trees.
One day, Takahashi gave him an integer sequence of length
N
,
a_1, a_2, ..., a_N
, which made him want to construct a tree.
Aoki wants to construct a tree with
N
vertices numbered
1
through
N
, such that for each
i = 1,2,...,N
, the distance between vertex
i
and the farthest vertex from it is
a_i
, assuming that the length of each edge is
1
.
Determine whether such a tree exists.
Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ a_i ≦ N-1
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1
a_2
...
a_N
Output
If there exists a tree that satisfies the condition, print
Possible
. Otherwise, print
Impossible
.
