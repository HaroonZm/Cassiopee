Problem C:
!
You are one of ICPC participants and in charge of developing a library for multiprecision numbers
and radix conversion. You have just finished writing the code, so next you have to test if it
works correctly. You decided to write a simple, well-known factorial function for this purpose:
Your task is to write a program that shows the number of trailing zeros when you compute
M
!
in base
N
, given
N
and
M
.
Input
The input contains multiple data sets. Each data set is described by one line in the format
below:
N M
where
N
is a decimal number between 8 and 36 inclusive, and
M
is given in the string repre-
sentation in base
N
. Exactly one white space character appears between them.
The string representation of
M
contains up to 12 characters in base
N
. In case
N
is greater
than 10, capital letters A, B, C, ... may appear in the string representation, and they represent
10, 11, 12, ..., respectively.
The input is terminated by a line containing two zeros. You should not process this line.
Output
For each data set, output a line containing a decimal integer, which is equal to the number of
trailing zeros in the string representation of
M
! in base
N
.
