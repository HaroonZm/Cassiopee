Problem Statement
We have a directed weighted graph with
N
vertices.
Each vertex has two integers written on it, and the integers written on Vertex
i
are
A_i
and
B_i
.
In this graph, there is an edge from Vertex
x
to Vertex
y
for all pairs
1 \leq x,y \leq N
, and its weight is
{\rm min}(A_x,B_y)
.
We will consider a directed cycle in this graph that visits every vertex exactly once.
Find the minimum total weight of the edges in such a cycle.
Constraints
2 \leq N \leq 10^5
1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Consider the cycle
1→3→2→1
. The weights of those edges are
{\rm min}(A_1,B_3)=1
,
{\rm min}(A_3,B_2)=2
and
{\rm min}(A_2,B_1)=4
, for a total of
7
.
As there is no cycle with a total weight of less than
7
, the answer is
7
.
