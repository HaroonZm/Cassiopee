Connected Components
Write a program which reads relations in a SNS (Social Network Service), and judges that given pairs of users are reachable each other through the network.
Input
In the first line, two integer $n$ and $m$ are given. $n$ is the number of users in the SNS and $m$ is the number of relations in the SNS. The users in the SNS are identified by IDs $0, 1, ..., n-1$.
In the following $m$ lines, the relations are given. Each relation is given by two integers $s$ and $t$ that represents $s$ and $t$ are friends (and reachable each other).
In the next line, the number of queries $q$ is given. In the following $q$ lines, $q$ queries are given respectively. Each query consists of two integers $s$ and $t$ separated by a space character.
Output
For each query, print "yes" if $t$ is reachable from $s$ through the social network, "no" otherwise.
Constraints
$2 \leq n \leq 100,000$
$0 \leq m \leq 100,000$
$1 \leq q \leq 10,000$
