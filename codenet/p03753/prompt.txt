Problem Statement
We have a grid with
n
rows and
7
columns. We call it a calendar. The cell at
i
-th row and
j
-th column is denoted
(i, j)
.
Initially, each cell at
(i, j)
contains the integer
7i + j - 8
, and each cell is white.
Snuke likes painting, so he decided integer
m
, and did
q
operations with a calendar.
・In
i
-th operation, he paint black on the cell in which an integer is written such remainder of dividing by
m
is
a_i
.
Please count the number of connected white parts.
Note that if two adjacent cells are white, the cells belong to the same connected part.
Input Format
