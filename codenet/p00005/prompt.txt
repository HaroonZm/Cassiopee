Voici un énoncé de problème :

GCD and LCM
Write a program which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of given
a
and
b
.
Input
Input consists of several data sets. Each data set contains
a
and
b
separated by a single space in a line. The input terminates with EOF.
Constraints
0 <
a, b
≤ 2,000,000,000
LCM(
a, b
) ≤ 2,000,000,000
The number of data sets ≤ 50
Output
For each data set, print GCD and LCM separated by a single space in a line.
Sample Input
8 6
50000000 30000000
Output for the Sample Input
2 24
10000000 150000000
