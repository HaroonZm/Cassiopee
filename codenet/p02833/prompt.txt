Problem Statement
For an integer
n
not less than
0
, let us define
f(n)
as follows:
f(n) = 1
(if
n < 2
)
f(n) = n f(n-2)
(if
n \geq 2
)
Given is an integer
N
. Find the number of trailing zeros in the decimal notation of
f(N)
.
Constraints
0 \leq N \leq 10^{18}
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
Output
Print the number of trailing zeros in the decimal notation of
f(N)
.
Sample Input 1
12
Sample Output 1
1
f(12) = 12 × 10 × 8 × 6 × 4 × 2 = 46080
, which has one trailing zero.
Sample Input 2
5
Sample Output 2
0
f(5) = 5 × 3 × 1 = 15
, which has no trailing zeros.
Sample Input 3
1000000000000000000
Sample Output 3
124999999999999995
