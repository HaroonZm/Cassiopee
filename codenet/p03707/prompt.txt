Problem Statement
Nuske has a grid with
N
rows and
M
columns of squares. The rows are numbered
1
through
N
from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered
1
through
M
from left to right.
Each square in the grid is painted in either blue or white. If
S_{i,j}
is
1
, the square at the
i
-th row and
j
-th column is blue; if
S_{i,j}
is
0
, the square is white.
For every pair of two blue square
a
and
b
, there is at most one path that starts from
a
, repeatedly proceeds to an adjacent (side by side) blue square and finally reaches
b
, without traversing the same square more than once.
Phantom Thnook, Nuske's eternal rival, gives
Q
queries to Nuske. The
i
-th query consists of four integers
x_{i,1}
,
y_{i,1}
,
x_{i,2}
and
y_{i,2}
and asks him the following: when the rectangular region of the grid bounded by (and including) the
x_{i,1}
-th row,
x_{i,2}
-th row,
y_{i,1}
-th column and
y_{i,2}
-th column is cut out, how many connected components consisting of blue squares there are in the region?
Process all the queries.
Constraints
1 ≤ N,M ≤ 2000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 200000
S_{i,j}
is either
0
or
1
.
S_{i,j}
satisfies the condition explained in the statement.
1 ≤ x_{i,1} ≤ x_{i,2} ≤ N(1 ≤ i ≤ Q)
1 ≤ y_{i,1} ≤ y_{i,2} ≤ M(1 ≤ i ≤ Q)

Output
For each query, print the number of the connected components consisting of blue squares in the region.

In the first query, the whole grid is specified. There are three components consisting of blue squares, and thus
3
should be printed.
In the second query, the region within the red frame is specified. There are two components consisting of blue squares, and thus
2
should be printed.
Note that squares that belong to the same component in the original grid may belong to different components.
