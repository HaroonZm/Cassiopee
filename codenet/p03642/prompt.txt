1
,
2
,
3
,
...
Initially, Cards
x_1
,
x_2
,
...
,
x_N
are face up, and the others are face down.
Snuke can perform the following operation repeatedly:
Select a prime
p
greater than or equal to
3
. Then, select
p
consecutive cards and flip all of them.
Snuke's objective is to have all the cards face down.
Find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective.
