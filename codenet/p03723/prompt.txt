,
B
and
C
cookies, respectively. Now, they will exchange those cookies by repeating the action below:
Each person simultaneously divides his cookies in half and gives one half to each of the other two persons.
This action will be repeated until there is a person with odd number of cookies in hand.
How many times will they repeat this action?
Note that the answer may not be finite.
Constraints
1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 10^9
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A
B
C
Output
Print the number of times the action will be performed by the three people, if this number is finite.
If it is infinite, print
-1
instead.

4 12 20
Sample Output 1
3
Initially, Takahashi, Aoki and Snuke have
4
,
12
and
20
cookies. Then,
After the first action, they have
16
,
12
and
8
.
After the second action, they have
10
,
12
and
14
.
After the third action, they have
13
,
12
and
11
.
Now, Takahashi and Snuke have odd number of cookies, and therefore the answer is
3
.
