Problem I:
Tatami
A tatami mat, a Japanese traditional floor cover, has a rectangular form with aspect ratio 1:2. When
spreading tatami mats on a floor, it is prohibited to make a cross with the border of the tatami mats,
because it is believed to bring bad luck.
Your task is to write a program that reports how many possible ways to spread tatami mats of the same
size on a floor of given height and width.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset cosists of a line which contains two integers
H
and
W
in this order, separated with a single
space.
H
and
W
are the height and the width of the floor respectively. The length of the shorter edge of a
tatami mat is regarded as a unit length.
You may assume 0 <
H
,
W
≤ 20.
The last dataset is followed by a line containing two zeros. This line is not a part of any dataset and should not be processed.
Output
For each dataset, print the number of possible ways to spread tatami mats in one line.
Sample Input
3 4
4 4
0 0
Output for the Sample Input
