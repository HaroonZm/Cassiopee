Voici un énoncé de problème :

Pattern Search
Find places where a
R
×
C
pattern is found within a
H
×
W
region. Print top-left coordinates (
i
,
j
) of sub-regions where the pattern found. The top-left and bottom-right coordinates of the region is (0, 0) and (
H
-1,
W
-1) respectively.
Input
In the first line, two integers
H
and
W
are given. In the following
H
lines,
i
-th lines of the region are given.
In the next line, two integers
R
and
C
are given. In the following
R
lines,
i
-th lines of the pattern are given.
output
For each sub-region found, print a coordinate
i
and
j
separated by a space character in a line. Print the coordinates in ascending order of the row numbers (
i
), or the column numbers (
j
) in case of a tie.
