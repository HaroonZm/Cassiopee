Voici un énoncé de problème :

Hit and Blow
Let's play Hit and Blow game.
A
imagines four numbers and
B
guesses the numbers. After
B
picks out four numbers,
A
answers:
The number of numbers which have the same place with numbers
A
imagined (Hit)
The number of numbers included (but different place) in the numbers
A
imagined (Blow)
For example, if
A
imagined numbers:
9 1 8 2
and
B
chose:
4 1 5 9
A
should say 1 Hit and 1 Blow.
Write a program which reads four numbers
A
imagined and four numbers
B
chose and prints the number of Hit and Blow respectively. You may assume that the four numbers are all different and within from 0 to 9.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset set consists of:
a
1
a
2
a
3
a
4
b
1
b
2
b
3
b
4
, where
a
i
(0 ≤
a
i
≤ 9) is
i
-th number
A
imagined and
b
i
(0 ≤
b
i
≤ 9) is
i
-th number
B
chose.
The input ends with EOF. The number of datasets is less than or equal to 50.
Output
For each dataset, print the number of Hit and Blow in a line. These two numbers should be separated by a space.
Sample Input
9 1 8 2
4 1 5 9
4 6 8 2
4 6 3 2
Output for the Sample Input
1 1
3 0
