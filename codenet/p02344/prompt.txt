Voici un énoncé de problème :

Weighted Union Find Trees
There is a sequence $A = a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}$. You are given the following information and questions.
relate$(x, y, z)$: $a_y$ is greater than $a_x$ by $z$
diff$(x, y)$: report the difference between $a_x$ and $a_y$ $(a_y - a_x)$
Input
$n \; q$
$query_1$
$query_2$
:
$query_q$
In the first line, $n$ and $q$ are given. Then, $q$ information/questions are given in the following format.
0 $x \; y\; z$
or
1 $x \; y$
where '
0
' of the first digit denotes the relate information and '
1
' denotes the diff question.
Output
For each diff question, print the difference between $a_x$ and $a_y$ $(a_y - a_x)$.
Constraints
$2 \leq n \leq 100,000$
$1 \leq q \leq 200,000$
$0 \leq x, y < n$
$x \ne y$
$0 \leq z \leq 10000$
There are no inconsistency in the given information
