Problem Statement
Given is a string
S
of length
N-1
.
Each character in
S
is
<
or
>
.
A sequence of
N
non-negative integers,
a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_N
, is said to be
good
when the following condition is satisfied for all
i
(
1 \leq i \leq N-1
):
If
S_i=
<
:
a_i<a_{i+1}
If
S_i=
>
:
a_i>a_{i+1}
Find the minimum possible sum of the elements of a good sequence of
N
non-negative integers.
Constraints
