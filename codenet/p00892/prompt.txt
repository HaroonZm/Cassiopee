Problem I:
Intersection of Two Prisms
Suppose that
P
1
is an infinite-height prism whose axis is parallel to the
z
-axis, and
P
2
is also an infinite-height prism whose axis is parallel to the
y
-axis.
P
1
is defined by the polygon
C
1
which is the cross section of
P
1
and the
xy
-plane, and
P
2
is also defined by the polygon
C
2
which is the cross section of
P
2
and the
x
z-plane.
Figure I.1 shows two cross sections which appear as the first dataset in the sample input, and
Figure I.2 shows the relationship between the prisms and their cross sections.
Figure I.1: Cross sections of Prisms
Figure I.2: Prisms and their cross sections
Figure I.3: Intersection of two prisms
Figure I.3 shows the intersection of two prisms in Figure I.2, namely,
P
1
and
P
2
.
Write a program which calculates the volume of the intersection of two prisms.
Input
The input is a sequence of datasets. The number of datasets is less than 200.
Each dataset is formatted as follows.

m
and

are integers (3 ≤

≤ 100, 3 ≤

≤ 100) which represent the numbers of the vertices of the polygons,
C
1
and
C
2
, respectively.

) and (
x
2
j
,
z
2
j
) mean the
i
-th and
j
-th vertices' positions of
C
1
and
C
2
respectively.
The sequences of these vertex positions are given in the counterclockwise order either on the
xy
-plane or the
xz
-plane as in Figure I.1.
You may assume that all the polygons are
convex
, that is, all the interior angles of the polygons are less than 180 degrees. You may also assume that all the polygons are
simple
, that is, each polygon's boundary does not cross nor touch itself.
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros.
Output
For each dataset, output the volume of the intersection of the two prisms,
P
1
and
P
2
, with a decimal representation in a line.
None of the output values may have an error greater than 0.001. The output should not contain any other extra characters.
