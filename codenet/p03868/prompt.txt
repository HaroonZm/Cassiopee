Problem Statement
There are
N
computers and
N
sockets in a one-dimensional world.
The coordinate of the
i
-th computer is
a_i
, and the coordinate of the
i
-th socket is
b_i
.
It is guaranteed that these
2N
coordinates are pairwise distinct.
Snuke wants to connect each computer to a socket using a cable.
Each socket can be connected to only one computer.
In how many ways can he minimize the total length of the cables?
Compute the answer modulo
10^9+7
.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9
The coordinates are integers.
The coordinates are pairwise distinct.
