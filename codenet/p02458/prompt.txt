Multi-Set
For a set $S$ of integers, perform a sequence of the following operations. Note that
multiple elements can have equivalent values in $S$
.
insert($x$): Insert $x$ to $S$ and report the number of elements in $S$ after the operation.
find($x$): Report the number of $x$ in $S$.
delete($x$): Delete all $x$ from $S$.
dump($L$, $R$): Print elements $x$ in $S$ such that $L \leq x \leq R$.
Input
The input is given in the following format.
$q$
$query_1$
$query_2$
:
$query_q$
Each query $query_i$ is given by
0 $x$
or
1 $x$
or
2 $x$
or
3 $L$ $R$
where the first digits
0
,
1
,
2
and
3
represent insert, find, delete and dump operations respectively.
Output
For each insert operation, print the number of elements in $S$.
For each find operation, print the number of specified elements in $S$.
For each dump operation, print the corresponding elements in ascending order. Print an element in a line.
Constraints
$1 \leq q \leq 200,000$
$0 \leq x \leq 1,000,000,000$
The total number of elements printed by dump operations does not exceed $1,000,000$
The sum of numbers printed by find operations does not exceed $2,000,000$
