Problem Statement
You are given three strings
A, B
and
C
. Each of these is a string of length
N
consisting of lowercase English letters.
Our objective is to make all these three strings equal. For that, you can repeatedly perform the following operation:
Operation: Choose one of the strings
A, B
and
C
, and specify an integer
i
between
1
and
N
(inclusive). Change the
i
-th character from the beginning of the chosen string to some other lowercase English letter.
What is the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective?
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 100
Each of the strings
A, B
and
C
is a string of length
N
.
Each character in each of the strings
A, B
and
C
is a lowercase English letter.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A
B
C
Output
Print the minimum number of operations required.
Sample Input 1
4
west
east
wait
Sample Output 1
3
In this sample, initially
A =
west
、
B =
east
、
C =
wait
. We can achieve the objective in the minimum number of operations by performing three operations as follows:
Change the second character in
A
to
a
.
A
is now
wast
.
Change the first character in
B
to
w
.
B
is now
wast
.
Change the third character in
C
to
s
.
C
is now
wast
.
Sample Input 2

Sample Output 2
0
If
A, B
and
C
are already equal in the beginning, the number of operations required is
0
.
