Priority Queue
A priority queue is a data structure which maintains a set $S$ of elements, each of with an associated value (key), and supports the following operations:
$insert(S, k)$: insert an element $k$ into the set $S$
$extractMax(S)$: remove and return the element of $S$ with the largest key
Write a program which performs the $insert(S, k)$ and $extractMax(S)$ operations to a priority queue $S$.
The priority queue manages a set of integers, which are also keys for the priority.
Input
Multiple operations to the priority queue $S$ are given. Each operation is given by "
insert
$k$", "
extract
" or "
end
" in a line. Here, $k$ represents an integer element to be inserted to the priority queue.
The input ends with "
end
" operation.
Output
For each "
extract
" operation, print the element extracted from the priority queue $S$ in a line.
Constraints
The number of operations $\leq 2,000,000$
$0 \leq k \leq 2,000,000,000$
Sample Input 1
