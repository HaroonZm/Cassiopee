Voici un énoncé de problème :

Articulation Points
Find articulation points of a given undirected graph
G(V, E)
.
A vertex in an undirected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it disconnects the graph.
Input
|V|
|E|
s
0
t
0
s
1
t
1
:
s
|E|-1
t
|E|-1
, where
|V|
is the number of vertices and
|E|
is the number of edges in the graph. The graph vertices are named with the numbers 0, 1,...,
|V|
-1 respectively.
s
i
and
t
i
represent source and target verticess of
i
-th edge (undirected).
Output
A list of
articulation points
of the graph
G
ordered by name.
Constraints
1 ≤
|V|
≤ 100,000
0 ≤
|E|
≤ 100,000
The graph is connected
There are no parallel edges
There are no self-loops
