Problem Statement
Mountaineers Mr. Takahashi and Mr. Aoki recently trekked across a certain famous mountain range.
The mountain range consists of
N
mountains, extending from west to east in a straight line as Mt.
1
, Mt.
2
, ..., Mt.
N
.
Mr. Takahashi traversed the range from the west and Mr. Aoki from the east.
The height of Mt.
i
is
h_i
, but they have forgotten the value of each
h_i
.
Instead, for each
i
(
1 ≤ i ≤ N
), they recorded the maximum height of the mountains climbed up to the time they reached the peak of Mt.
i
(including Mt.
i
).
Mr. Takahashi's record is
T_i
and Mr. Aoki's record is
A_i
.
We know that the height of each mountain
h_i
is a positive integer.
Compute the number of the possible sequences of the mountains' heights, modulo
10^9 + 7
.
Note that the records may be incorrect and thus there may be no possible sequence of the mountains' heights.
In such a case, output
0
.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ T_i ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9
T_i ≤ T_{i+1}
(
1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1
)
A_i ≥ A_{i+1}
(
1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1
)
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
T_1
T_2
...
T_N
A_1
A_2
...
A_N
Output
Print the number of possible sequences of the mountains' heights, modulo
10^9 + 7
.

The possible sequences of the mountains' heights are:
1, 3, 2, 2, 2
1, 3, 2, 1, 2
1, 3, 1, 2, 2
1, 3, 1, 1, 2
for a total of four sequences.
Sample Input 2

1 1 1 2 2
3 2 1 1 1
Sample Output 2
0
The records are contradictory, since Mr. Takahashi recorded
2
as the highest peak after climbing all the mountains but Mr. Aoki recorded
3
.
