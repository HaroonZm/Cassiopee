Problem G. Additions
You are given an integer $N$ and a string consisting of '
+
' and digits. You are asked to transform the string into a valid formula whose calculation result is smaller than or equal to $N$ by modifying some characters. Here, you replace one character with another character any number of times, and the converted string should still consist of '
+
' and digits. Note that leading zeros and unary positive are prohibited.
For instance, '
0123+456
' is assumed as invalid because leading zero is prohibited. Similarly, '
+1+2
' and '
2++3
' are also invalid as they each contain a unary expression. On the other hand, '
12345
', '
0+1+2
' and '
1234+0+0
' are all valid.
Your task is to find the minimum number of the replaced characters. If there is no way to make a valid formula smaller than or equal to $N$, output $-1$ instead of the number of the replaced characters.
Input
The input consists of a single test case in the following format.
$N$
$S$
The first line contains an integer $N$, which is the upper limit of the formula ($1 \leq N \leq 10^9$). The second line contains a string $S$, which consists of '
+
' and digits and whose length is between $1$ and $1,000$, inclusive. Note that it is
not
guaranteed that initially $S$ is a valid formula.
Output
Output the minimized number of the replaced characters. If there is no way to replace, output $-1$ instead.

In the first example, you can modify the first two characters and make a formula '
1+23
', for instance. In the second example, you should make '
0+10
' or '
10+0
' by replacing all the characters. In the third example, you cannot make any valid formula less than or equal to $1$.
