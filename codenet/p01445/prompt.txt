Problem I:
Mobile Network
The trafic on the Internet is increasing these days due to smartphones. The wireless carriers
have to enhance their network infrastructure.
The network of a wireless carrier consists of a number of base stations and lines. Each line connects two base stations bi-directionally. The bandwidth of a line increases every year and is given by a polynomial
f
(
x
) of the year
x
.
Your task is, given the network structure, to write a program to calculate the maximal bandwidth between the 1-st and
N
-th base stations as a polynomial of
x
.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset has the following format:
N M
u
1
v
1
p
1
...
u
M
v
M
p
M
The first line of each dataset contains two integers
N
(2 ≤
N
≤ 50) and
M
(0 ≤
M
≤ 500), which indicates the number of base stations and lines respectively. The following
M
lines describe the network structure. The
i
-th of them corresponds to the
i
-th network line and contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
and a polynomial
p
i
.
u
i
and
v
i
indicate the indices of base stations (1 ≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤
N
);
p
i
indicates the network bandwidth.
Each polynomial has the form of:
a
L
x
L
+
a
L
-1
x
L
-1
+ ... +
a
2
x
2
+
a
1
x
+
a
0
where
L
(0 ≤
L
≤ 50) is the degree and
a
i
's (0 ≤
i
≤
L
, 0 ≤
a
i
≤ 100) are the coefficients. In the input,
each term
a
i
x
i
(for
i
≥ 2) is represented as <
a
i
>
x
^<
i
>
the linear term (
a
1
x
) is represented as <
a
1
>
x
;
the constant (
a
0
) is represented just by digits;
these terms are given in the strictly decreasing order of the degrees and connected by a
plus sign ("
+
");
just like the standard notations, the <
a
i
> is omitted if
a
i
= 1 for non-constant terms;
similarly, the entire term is omitted if
a
i
= 0 for any terms; and
the polynomial representations contain no space or characters other than digits, "x", "^", and "+".
For example, 2
x
2
+ 3
x
+ 5 is represented as
2x^2+3x+5
; 2
x
3
+
x
is represented as
2x^3+x
, not
2x^3+0x^2+1x+0
or the like. No polynomial is a constant zero, i.e. the one with all the coefficients being zero.
The end of input is indicated by a line with two zeros. This line is not part of any dataset.
Output
For each dataset, print the maximal bandwidth as a polynomial of
x
. The polynomial should be represented in the same way as the input format except that a constant zero is possible and should be represented by "0" (without quotes).
