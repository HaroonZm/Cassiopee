Carpenters' Language
International Carpenters Professionals Company (ICPC) is a top construction company with a lot of expert carpenters.
What makes ICPC a top company is their original language.
The syntax of the language is simply given in CFG as follows:
S -> SS | (S) | )S( | ε
In other words, a right parenthesis can be closed by a left parenthesis and a left parenthesis can be closed by a right parenthesis in this language.
Alex, a grad student mastering linguistics, decided to study ICPC's language.
As a first step of the study, he needs to judge whether a text is well-formed in the language or not.
Then, he asked you, a great programmer, to write a program for the judgement.
Alex's request is as follows: You have an empty string S in the beginning, and construct longer string by inserting a sequence of '(' or ')' into the string.
You will receive
q
queries, each of which consists of three elements
(p, c, n)
, where
p
is
the position to insert,
n
is the number of characters to insert and
c
is either '(' or ')', the character to insert.
For each query, your program should insert
c
repeated by
n
times into the
p
-th position of S from the beginning.
Also it should output, after performing each insert operation, "Yes" if S is in the language and "No" if S is not in the language.
Please help Alex to support his study, otherwise he will fail to graduate the college.
Input
The first line contains one integer
q
(
1 \leq q \leq 10^5
) indicating the number of queries, follows
q
lines of three elements,
p_i
,
c_i
,
n_i
, separated by a single space (
1 \leq i \leq q
,
c_i = '(' or ')'
,
0 \leq p_i \leq
length of S before
i
-th query,
1 \leq n \leq 2^{20}
).
It is guaranteed that all the queries in the input are valid.
Output
For each query, output "Yes" if S is in the language and "No" if S is not in the language.

```python
cnt = 0
for loop in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    a,c,n = raw_input().split()
    n = int(n)
    cnt += n if c == "(" else -n
    print "Yes" if cnt == 0 else "No"
