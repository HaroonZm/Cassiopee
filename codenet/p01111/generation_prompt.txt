Voici un énoncé de problème :

Skyscraper "MinatoHarukas"
Mr. Port plans to start a new business renting one or more floors
of the new skyscraper with one giga floors, MinatoHarukas.
He wants to rent as many vertically adjacent floors as possible,
because he wants to show advertisement on as many vertically
adjacent windows as possible.
The rent for one floor is proportional to the floor number,
that is, the rent per month for the
n
-th floor is
n
times
that of the first floor.
Here, the ground floor is called the first floor in the American style,
and basement floors are out of consideration for the renting.
In order to help Mr. Port, you should write a program that computes
the vertically adjacent floors satisfying his requirement and
whose total rental cost per month is
exactly equal
to his budget.
For example, when his budget is 15 units,
with one unit being the rent of the first floor,
there are four possible rent plans,
1+2+3+4+5, 4+5+6, 7+8, and 15.
For all of them, the sums are equal to 15.
Of course in this example the rent of maximal number of the floors
is that of 1+2+3+4+5, that is, the rent from the first floor to the fifth floor.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets,
each in the following format.
b
A dataset consists of one line,
the budget of Mr. Port
b
as multiples of the rent of the first floor.
b
is a positive integer satisfying 1 <
b
< 10
9
.
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a zero.
The number of datasets does not exceed 1000.
Output
For each dataset, output a single line containing two positive integers
representing the plan with the maximal number of vertically adjacent floors
with its rent price exactly equal to the budget of Mr. Port.
The first should be the lowest floor number and
the second should be the number of floors.
