Problem Statement
"Pizza At", a fast food chain, offers three kinds of pizza: "A-pizza", "B-pizza" and "AB-pizza". A-pizza and B-pizza are completely different pizzas, and AB-pizza is one half of A-pizza and one half of B-pizza combined together. The prices of one A-pizza, B-pizza and AB-pizza are
A
yen,
B
yen and
C
yen (yen is the currency of Japan), respectively.
Nakahashi needs to prepare
X
A-pizzas and
Y
B-pizzas for a party tonight. He can only obtain these pizzas by directly buying A-pizzas and B-pizzas, or buying two AB-pizzas and then rearrange them into one A-pizza and one B-pizza. At least how much money does he need for this? It is fine to have more pizzas than necessary by rearranging pizzas.
Constraints
1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 5000
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^5
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A
B
C
X
Y
Output
Print the minimum amount of money required to prepare
X
A-pizzas and
Y
B-pizzas.
Sample Input 1
1500 2000 1600 3 2
Sample Output 1
7900
It is optimal to buy four AB-pizzas and rearrange them into two A-pizzas and two B-pizzas, then buy additional one A-pizza.
Sample Input 2
1500 2000 1900 3 2
Sample Output 2
8500
It is optimal to directly buy three A-pizzas and two B-pizzas.
Sample Input 3
1500 2000 500 90000 100000
Sample Output 3
100000000
It is optimal to buy
200000
AB-pizzas and rearrange them into
100000
A-pizzas and
100000
B-pizzas. We will have
10000
more A-pizzas than necessary, but that is fine.


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
a, b, c, x, y = map(int, input().split())

if x < y:
    a, b = b, a
    x, y = y, x

case1 = a * x + b * y
case2 = c * 2 * y + (x - y) * a
case3 = c * 2 * x

print(min(case1, case2, case3))
```
