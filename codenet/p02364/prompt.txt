Minimum Spanning Tree
Find the sum of weights of edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree for a given weighted undirected graph
G
= (
V
,
E
).
Input
|V|
|E|
s

:
s
|E|-1
t
|E|-1
w
|E|-1
, where
|V|
is the number of vertices and
|E|
is the number of edges in the graph. The graph vertices are named with the numbers 0, 1,...,
|V|
-1 respectively.
s
i
and
t
i
represent source and target verticess of
i
-th edge (undirected) and
w
i
represents the weight of the
i
-th edge.
Output
Print the sum of the weights of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
