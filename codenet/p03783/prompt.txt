Problem Statement
AtCoDeer the deer found
N
rectangle lying on the table, each with height
1
.
If we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the
i
-th rectangle
i(1≤i≤N)
covers the vertical range of
[i-1,i]
and the horizontal range of
[l_i,r_i]
, as shown in the following figure:
AtCoDeer will move these rectangles horizontally so that all the rectangles are connected.
For each rectangle, the cost to move it horizontally by a distance of
x
, is
x
.
Find the minimum cost to achieve connectivity.
It can be proved that this value is always an integer under the constraints of the problem.
Constraints
All input values are integers.
1≤N≤10^5
1≤l_i<r_i≤10^9
Partial Score
