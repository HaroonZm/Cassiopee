Problem Statement
There is a string
S
of length
N
consisting of characters
0
and
1
. You will perform the following operation for each
i = 1, 2, ..., m
:
Arbitrarily permute the characters within the substring of
S
starting at the
l_i
-th character from the left and extending through the
r_i
-th character.
Here, the sequence
l_i
is non-decreasing.
How many values are possible for
S
after the
M
operations, modulo
1000000007(= 10^9+7)
?
Constraints
2≦N≦3000
1≦M≦3000
S
