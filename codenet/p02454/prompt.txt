Voici un énoncé de problème :

Equal Range
For a given sequence $A = \{a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}\}$ which is sorted by ascending order, print a pair of the lower bound and the upper bound for a specific value $k$ given as a query.
lower bound: the place pointing to the first element greater than or equal to a specific value, or $n$ if there is no such element.
upper bound: the place pointing to the first element greater than a specific value, or $n$ if there is no such element.
Input
The input is given in the following format.
$n$
$a_0 \; a_1 \; ,..., \; a_{n-1}$
$q$
$k_1$
$k_2$
:
$k_q$
The number of elements $n$ and each element $a_i$ are given in the first line and the second line respectively. In the third line, the number of queries $q$ is given and the following $q$ lines, $q$ integers $k_i$ are given as queries.
Output
For each query, print the pari of the lower bound $l$ ($l = 0, 1, ..., n$) and upper bound $r$ ($r = 0, 1, ..., n$) separated by a space character in a line.
Constraints
$1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
$1 \leq q \leq 200,000$
$0 \leq a_0 \leq a_1 \leq ... \leq a_{n-1} \leq 1,000,000,000$
$0 \leq k_i \leq 1,000,000,000$
