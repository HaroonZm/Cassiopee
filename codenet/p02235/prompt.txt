Longest Common Subsequence
For given two sequences $X$ and $Y$, a sequence $Z$ is a common subsequence of $X$ and $Y$ if $Z$ is a subsequence of both $X$ and $Y$. For example, if $X = \{a,b,c,b,d,a,b\}$ and $Y = \{b,d,c,a,b,a\}$, the sequence $\{b,c,a\}$ is a common subsequence of both $X$ and $Y$. On the other hand, the sequence $\{b,c,a\}$ is not a longest common subsequence (LCS) of $X$ and $Y$, since it has length 3 and the sequence $\{b,c,b,a\}$, which is also common to both $X$ and $Y$, has length 4. The sequence $\{b,c,b,a\}$ is an LCS of $X$ and $Y$, since there is no common subsequence of length 5 or greater.
Write a program which finds the length of LCS of given two sequences $X$ and $Y$. The sequence consists of alphabetical characters.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. In the first line, an integer $q$ which is the number of datasets is given. In the following $2 \times q$ lines, each dataset which consists of the two sequences $X$ and $Y$ are given.
Output
For each dataset, print the length of LCS of $X$ and $Y$ in a line.
Constraints
$1 \leq q \leq 150$
$1 \leq$ length of $X$ and $Y$ $\leq 1,000$
$q \leq 20$ if the dataset includes a sequence whose length is more than 100
