Voici un énoncé de problème :

Three-way Branch
There is a grid that consists of
W \times H
cells. The upper-left-most cell is
(1, 1)
.
You are standing on the cell of
(1,1)
and you are going to move to cell of
(W, H)
.
You can only move to adjacent lower-left, lower or lower-right cells.
There are obstructions on several cells. You can not move to it. You cannot move out the grid, either.
Write a program that outputs the number of ways to reach
(W,H)
modulo 1,000,000,009.
You can assume that there is no obstruction at
(1,1)
.
Input
The first line contains three integers, the width
W
, the height
H
, and the number of obstructions
N
.
(
1 \leq W \leq 75
,
2 \leq H \leq 10^{18}
,
0 \leq N \leq 30
)
Each of following
N
lines contains 2 integers, denoting the position of an obstruction
(x_i, y_i)
.
The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.
Output
For each test case, print its case number and the number of ways to reach
(W,H)
modulo 1,000,000,009.
Sample Input
2 4 1
2 1
2 2 1
2 2
0 0 0
Output for the Sample Input
Case 1: 4
Case 2: 0
