Problem H:
Fibonacci Sets
Fibonacci number
f
(
i
) appear in a variety of puzzles in nature and math, including packing problems, family trees or Pythagorean triangles. They obey the rule
f
(
i
) =
f
(
i
- 1) +
f
(
i
- 2), where we set
f
(0) = 1 =
f
(-1).
Let
V
and
d
be two certain positive integers and be
N
≡ 1001 a constant. Consider a set of
V
nodes, each node
i
having a Fibonacci label
F
[
i
] = (
f
(
i
) mod N) assigned for
i
= 1,...,
V
≤ N. If |
F
(
i
) -
F
(
j
)| <
d
, then the nodes
i
and
j
are connected.
Given
V
and
d
, how many connected subsets of nodes will you obtain?
Figure 1: There are 4 connected subsets for
V
= 20 and
d
= 100.
Input
Each data set is defined as one line with two integers as follows:
Line 1
: Number of nodes
V
and the distance
d
.
Input includes several data sets (i.e., several lines). The number of dat sets is less than or equal to 50.
Constraints
1 ≤ V ≤ 1000
1 ≤ d ≤ 150
Output
Output line contains one integer - the number of connected subsets - for each input line.
