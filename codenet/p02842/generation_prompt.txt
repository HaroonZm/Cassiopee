Problem Statement
Takahashi bought a piece of apple pie at ABC Confiserie. According to his memory, he paid
N
yen (the currency of Japan) for it.
The consumption tax rate for foods in this shop is
8
percent. That is, to buy an apple pie priced at
X
yen before tax, you have to pay
X \times 1.08
yen (rounded down to the nearest integer).
Takahashi forgot the price of his apple pie before tax,
X
, and wants to know it again. Write a program that takes
N
as input and finds
X
. We assume
X
is an integer.
If there are multiple possible values for
X
, find any one of them. Also, Takahashi's memory of
N
, the amount he paid, may be incorrect. If no value could be
X
, report that fact.
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 50000
N
is an integer.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
Output
If there are values that could be
X
, the price of the apple pie before tax, print any one of them.
If there are multiple such values, printing any one of them will be accepted.
If no value could be
X
, print
:(
.
Sample Input 1
432
Sample Output 1
400
If the apple pie is priced at
400
yen before tax, you have to pay
400 \times 1.08 = 432
yen to buy one.
Otherwise, the amount you have to pay will not be
432
yen.
Sample Input 2
1079
Sample Output 2
:(
There is no possible price before tax for which you have to pay
1079
yen with tax.
Sample Input 3
1001
Sample Output 3
927
If the apple pie is priced
927
yen before tax, by rounding down
927 \times 1.08 = 1001.16
, you have to pay
1001
yen.


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
import math

# Input the amount of money Takahashi paid
N = int(input())

# Find nearest integer price more than or equal to X/1.08
X = math.ceil(N / 1.08)

# Check if the "taxed price" is equal to N yen
if math.floor(X * 1.08) == N:
	print(X)
else:
	print(":(")
```
