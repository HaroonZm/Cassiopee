Problem Statement
Takahashi has two positive integers
A
and
B
.
It is known that
A
plus
B
equals
N
.
Find the minimum possible value of "the sum of the digits of
A
" plus "the sum of the digits of
B
" (in base
10
).
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
N
is an integer.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
Output

A
" plus "the sum of the digits of
B
".
Sample Input 1
15
Sample Output 1
6
When
A=2
and
B=13
, the sums of their digits are
2
and
4
, which minimizes the value in question.
