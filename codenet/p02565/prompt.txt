Problem Statement
Consider placing
N
flags on a line. Flags are numbered through
1
to
N
.
Flag
i
can be placed on the coordinate
X_i
or
Y_i
.
For any two different flags, the distance between them should be at least
D
.
Decide whether it is possible to place all
N
flags. If it is possible, print such a configulation.
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 1000
0 \leq D \leq 10^9
0 \leq X_i < Y_i \leq 10^9
All values in Input are integer.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
D
X_1
Y_1
X_2
Y_2
\vdots
X_N
Y_N
Output
Print
No
if it is impossible to place
N
flags.
If it is possible, print
Yes
first.
After that, print
N
lines.
i
-th line of them should contain the coodinate of flag
