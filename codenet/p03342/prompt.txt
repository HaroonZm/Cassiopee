Problem Statement
There is an integer sequence
A
of length
N
.
Find the number of the pairs of integers
l
and
r
(
1 \leq l \leq r \leq N
) that satisfy the following condition:
A_l\ xor\ A_{l+1}\ xor\ ...\ xor\ A_r = A_l\ +\ A_{l+1}\ +\ ...\ +\ A_r
Here,
xor
denotes the bitwise exclusive OR.
Definition of XOR
The XOR of integers
c_1, c_2, ..., c_m
is defined as follows:
Let the XOR be
X
. In the binary representation of
X
, the digit in the
2^k
's place (
0 \leq k
;
k
is an integer) is
1
if there are an odd number of integers among
c_1, c_2, ...c_m
whose binary representation has
1
in the
2^k
's place, and
0
if that number is even.
For example, let us compute the XOR of
3
and
5
. The binary representation of
3
is
011
, and the binary representation of
5
is
101
, thus the XOR has the binary representation
110
, that is, the XOR is
6
.
