i
-th card has an integer
X_i
on it.
Takahashi is trying to create as many pairs of cards as possible satisfying one of the following conditions:
The integers on the two cards are the same.
The sum of the integers on the two cards is a multiple of
M
.
Find the maximum number of pairs that can be created.
Note that a card cannot be used in more than one pair.

Sample Output 1
3
Three pairs
(3,2), (1,4)
and
(1,9)
can be created.
It is possible to create pairs
(3,2)
and
(1,1)
, but the number of pairs is not maximized with this.
