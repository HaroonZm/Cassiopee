Traveling Salesman Problem
For a given weighted directed graph
G(V, E)
, find the distance of the shortest route that meets the following criteria:
It is a closed cycle where it ends at the same point it starts.
It visits each vertex exactly once.
Input
|V|
|E|
s
0
t
0
d
0
s

|E|-1
d
|E|-1
|V|
is the number of vertices and
|E|
is the number of edges in the graph. The graph vertices are named with the numbers 0, 1,...,
|V|
-1 respectively.
s
i
and
t
i
represent source and target vertices of
i
-th edge (directed) and
d
i
represents the distance between
s
i
and
t
i
(the
i
-th edge).
Output
Print the shortest distance in a line. If there is no solution, print -1.
Constraints
2 ≤
|V|
≤ 15
0 ≤
d
i
≤ 1,000
There are no multiedge
