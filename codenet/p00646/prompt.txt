Problem J:
No Story
Since I got tired to write long problem statements, I decided to make this problem statement short. For given positive integer
L
, how many pairs of positive integers
a
,
b
(
a
≤
b
) such that LCM(
a
,
b
) =
L
are there? Here, LCM(
a
,
b
) stands for the least common multiple of
a
and
b
.
Input
For each dataset, an integer
L
is given in a line. Input terminates when
L
= 0.
Output
For each dataset, output the number of pairs of
a
and
b
.
