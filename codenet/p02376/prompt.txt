Maximum Flow
A flow network is a directed graph which has a $source$ and a $sink$. In a flow network, each edge $(u, v)$ has a capacity $c(u, v)$. Each edge receives a flow, but the amount of flow on the edge can not exceed the corresponding capacity. Find the maximum flow from the $source$ to the $sink$.
Input
A flow network is given in the following format.
$|V|\;|E|$
$u_0\;v_0\;c_0$
$u_1\;v_1\;c_1$
:
$u_{|E|-1}\;v_{|E|-1}\;c_{|E|-1}$
$|V|$, $|E|$ is the number of vertices and edges of the flow network respectively. The vertices in $G$ are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., $|V|-1$. The source is 0 and the sink is $|V|-1$.
$u_i$, $v_i$, $c_i$ represent $i$-th edge of the flow network.
A pair of $u_i$ and $v_i$ denotes that there is an edge from $u_i$ to $v_i$ and $c_i$ is the capacity of $i$-th edge.
Output
Print the maximum flow.
Constraints
$2 \leq |V| \leq 100$
$1 \leq |E| \leq 1000$
$0 \leq c_i \leq 10000$
