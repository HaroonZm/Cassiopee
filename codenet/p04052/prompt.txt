Problem Statement
You are given a permutation
P_1 ... P_N
of the set {
1
,
2
, ...,
N
}.
You can apply the following operation to this permutation, any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose two indices
i,j (1 ≦ i < j ≦ N)
, such that
j - i ≧ K
and
|P_i - P_j| = 1
.
Then, swap the values of
P_i
and
P_j
.
Among all permutations that can be obtained by applying this operation to the given permutation, find the lexicographically smallest one.
Constraints
2≦N≦500,000
1≦K≦N-1
P
