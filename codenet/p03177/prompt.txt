Problem Statement
There is a simple directed graph
G
with
N
vertices, numbered
1, 2, \ldots, N
.
For each
i
and
j
(
1 \leq i, j \leq N
), you are given an integer
a_{i, j}
that represents whether there is a directed edge from Vertex
i
to
j
.
If
a_{i, j} = 1
, there is a directed edge from Vertex
i
to
j
; if
a_{i, j} = 0
, there is not.
Find the number of different directed paths of length
K
in
G
, modulo
10^9 + 7
.
We will also count a path that traverses the same edge multiple times.
Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 \leq N \leq 50
1 \leq K \leq 10^{18}
a_{i, j}
is
0
or
1
.
a_{i, i} = 0
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
K
a_{1, 1}
\ldots
a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1}
\ldots
a_{N, N}
Output
Print the number of different directed paths of length
K
in
G
, modulo
10^9 + 7
.
