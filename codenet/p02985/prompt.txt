Problem Statement
You are given a tree with
N
vertices and
N-1
edges. The vertices are numbered
1
to
N
, and the
i
-th edge connects Vertex
a_i
and
b_i
.
You have coloring materials of
K
colors.
For each vertex in the tree, you will choose one of the
K
colors to paint it, so that the following condition is satisfied:
If the distance between two different vertices
x
and
y
is less than or equal to two,
x
and
y
have different colors.
How many ways are there to paint the tree? Find the count modulo
1\ 000\ 000\ 007
.
