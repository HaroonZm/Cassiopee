B - Integer in Integer
Problem Statement
Given an integer interval
\[A, B\]
and an integer
C
, your job is to calculate the number of occurrences of
C
as string in the interval.
For example,
33
appears in
333
twice, and appears in
334
once. Thus the number of occurrences of
33
in
\[333, 334\]
is
3
.
Input
The test case is given by a line with the three integers,
A
,
B
,
C
(
0 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{10000}
,
0 \leq C \leq 10^{500}
).
Output
Print the number of occurrences of
C
mod 1000000007.
