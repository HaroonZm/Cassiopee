Coin Combination Problem
You have 4 bags A, B, C and D each of which includes
N
coins (there are totally
4N
coins). Values of the coins in each bag are
a
i
,
b
i
,
c
i
and
d
i
respectively.
Find the number of combinations that result when you choose one coin from each bag (totally
4
coins) in such a way that the total value of the coins is
V
. You should distinguish the coins in a bag.
