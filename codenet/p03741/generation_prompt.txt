Problem Statement
You are given an integer sequence of length
N
. The
i
-th term in the sequence is
a_i
.
In one operation, you can select a term and either increment or decrement it by one.
At least how many operations are necessary to satisfy the following conditions?
For every
i
(1≤i≤n)
, the sum of the terms from the
1
-st through
i
-th term is not zero.
For every
i
(1≤i≤n-1)
, the sign of the sum of the terms from the
1
-st through
i
-th term, is different from the sign of the sum of the terms from the
1
-st through
(i+1)
-th term.
Constraints
2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
|a_i| ≤ 10^9
Each
a_i
is an integer.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
a_1
a_2
...
a_n
Output
Print the minimum necessary count of operations.
Sample Input 1
4
1 -3 1 0
Sample Output 1
4
For example, the given sequence can be transformed into
1, -2, 2, -2
by four operations. The sums of the first one, two, three and four terms are
1, -1, 1
and
-1
, respectively, which satisfy the conditions.
Sample Input 2
5
3 -6 4 -5 7
Sample Output 2
0
The given sequence already satisfies the conditions.
Sample Input 3
6
-1 4 3 2 -5 4
Sample Output 3
8
