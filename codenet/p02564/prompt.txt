Problem Statement
You are given a directed graph with
N
vertices and
M
edges, not necessarily simple. The
i
-th edge is oriented from the vertex
a_i
to the vertex
b_i
.
Divide this graph into strongly connected components and print them in their topological order.
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 500,000
1 \leq M \leq 500,000
0 \leq a_i, b_i < N
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
M
a_0
b_0
a_1
b_1
:
a_{M - 1}
b_{M - 1}
Output
Print
1+K
lines, where
K
is the number of strongly connected components.
Print
K
on the first line.
Print the information of each strongly connected component in next
K
lines in the following format, where
l
is the number of vertices in the strongly connected component and
v_i
is the index of the vertex in it.
l
v_0
v_1
...
v_{l-1}
Here, for each edge
(a_i, b_i)
,
b_i
should not appear in
earlier
line than
a_i
.
If there are multiple correct output, print any of them.
