0-1 Knapsack Problem II
You have
N
items that you want to put them into a knapsack. Item
i
has value
v
i
and weight
w
i
.
You want to find a subset of items to put such that:
The total value of the items is as large as possible.
The items have combined weight at most
W
, that is capacity of the knapsack.
Find the maximum total value of items in the knapsack.
