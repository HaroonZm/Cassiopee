Problem Statement
You are given a connected undirected graph which has even numbers of nodes.
A connected graph is a graph in which all nodes are connected directly or indirectly by edges.
Your task is to find a spanning tree whose median value of edges' costs is minimum.
A spanning tree of a graph means that a tree which contains all nodes of the graph.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets.
The format of each dataset is as follows.
n
m
s_1
t_1
c_1
...
s_m
t_m
c_m
The first line contains an even number
n
(
2 \leq n \leq 1,000
) and an integer
m
(n-1 \leq m \leq 10,000)
.
n
is the nubmer of nodes and
m
is the number of edges in the graph.
Then
m
lines follow, each of which contains
s_i
(
1 \leq s_i \leq n
),
t_i
(
1 \leq s_i \leq n, t_i \neq s_i
) and
c_i
(
1 \leq c_i \leq 1,000
).
This means there is an edge between the nodes
s_i
and
t_i
and its cost is
c_i
.
There is no more than one edge which connects
s_i
and
t_i
.
The input terminates when
n=0
and
m=0
.
Your program must not output anything for this case.
Output
Print the median value in a line for each dataset.
