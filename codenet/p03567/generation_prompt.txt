Problem Statement
Snuke built an online judge to hold a programming contest.
When a program is submitted to the judge, the judge returns a verdict, which is a two-character string that appears in the string
S
as a contiguous substring.
(The judge can return any two-character substring of
S
.)
Determine whether the judge can return the string
AC
as the verdict to a program.
Constraints
2 \leq |S| \leq 5
S
consists of uppercase English letters.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
Output
If the judge can return the string
AC
as a verdict to a program, print
Yes
; if it cannot, print

Sample Input 1
BACD
Sample Output 1
Yes
The string
AC
appears in
BACD
as a contiguous substring (the second and third characters).
Sample Input 2
ABCD
Sample Output 2
No
Although the string

contains both
A
and
C
(the first and third characters), the string
AC
does not appear in
ABCD
as a contiguous substring.
Sample Input 3
CABD
Sample Output 3
