Fermat's Last Theorem
In the 17th century, Fermat wrote that he proved for any integer $n \geq 3$,
there exist no positive integers $x$, $y$, $z$ such that
$x^n + y^n = z^n$.
However he never disclosed the proof. Later, this claim was named
Fermat's Last Theorem or Fermat's Conjecture.
If Fermat's Last Theorem holds in case of $n$, then it also holds
in case of any multiple of $n$.
Thus it suffices to prove cases where $n$ is a prime number
and the special case $n$ = 4.
A proof for the case $n$ = 4 was found in Fermat's own memorandum.
The case $n$ = 3 was proved by Euler in the 18th century.
After that, many mathematicians attacked Fermat's Last Theorem.
Some of them proved some part of the theorem, which was a
partial success.
Many others obtained nothing.
It was a long history.
Finally, Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1994.
Fermat's Last Theorem implies that for any integers $n \geq 3$
and $z > 1$, it always holds that
$z^n > $ max { $x^n + y^n | x > 0, y > 0, x^n + y^n \leq z^n$ }.
Your mission is to write a program that verifies this in the case
$n$ = 3 for a given $z$. Your program should read in
integer numbers greater than 1, and, corresponding to each input
$z$, it should output the following:
$z^3 - $ max { $x^3 + y^3 | x > 0, y > 0, x^3 + y^3 \leq z^3$ }.
Input
The input is a sequence of lines each containing one positive integer
number followed by a line containing a zero. You may assume that all of
the input integers are greater than 1 and less than 1111.
Output
The output should consist of lines each containing a single
integer number. Each output integer should be
$z^3 - $ max { $x^3 + y^3 | x > 0, y > 0, x^3 + y^3 \leq z^3$ }.
for the corresponding input integer
z
.
No other characters should appear in any output line.
