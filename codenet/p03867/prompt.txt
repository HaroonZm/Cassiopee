Problem Statement
Takahashi and Aoki are going to together construct a sequence of integers.
First, Takahashi will provide a sequence of integers
a
, satisfying all of the following conditions:
The length of
a
is
N
.
Each element in
a
is an integer between
1
and
K
, inclusive.
a
is a
palindrome
, that is, reversing the order of elements in
a
will result in the same sequence as the original.
Then, Aoki will perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times:
Move the first element in
a
to the end of
a
.
How many sequences
a
can be obtained after this procedure, modulo
10^9+7
?
Constraints
1≤N≤10^9
1≤K≤10^9
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the number of the sequences
a
that can be obtained after the procedure, modulo
10^9+7
.
