The first integer
n
is the number of points in
g
.
In the following lines, the coordinate of the
i
-th point
p
i
is given by two real numbers
x
i
and
y
i
. The coordinates of points are given in the order of counter-clockwise visit of them. Each value is a real number with at most 6 digits after the decimal point.
Output
Print the diameter of
g
in a line. The output values should be in a decimal fraction with an error less than 0.000001.
Constraints
3 ≤

,
y
i
≤ 100
No point in the
g
will occur more than once.
