, one of the five Product Days in a year.
A date
m
-
d
(
m
is the month,
d
is the date) is called a Product Day when
d
is a two-digit number, and all of the following conditions are satisfied (here
d_{10}
is the tens digit of the day and
d_1
is the ones digit of the day):
d_1 \geq 2
d_{10} \geq 2
d_1 \times d_{10} = m
Takahashi wants more Product Days, and he made a new calendar called Takahashi Calendar where a year consists of
M
month from Month
1
to Month
M
, and each month consists of
D
days from Day
1
to Day
D
.
In Takahashi Calendar, how many Product Days does a year have?
Constraints

```python
from math import sqrt
M, D = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(1, M+1):
    for j in range(1, D+1):
        if j//10 >= 2 and j%10 >= 2:
            if (j//10)*(j%10) == i:
                ans += 1

print(ans)
