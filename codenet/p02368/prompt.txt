Strongly Connected Components
A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.
Input
A directed graph
G(V, E)
and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes
u
and
v
.

|V|
is the number of nodes and
|E|
is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,...,
|V|
-1 respectively.
s
i
and
t
i
represent source and target nodes of
i
-th edge (directed).
u
i
and
v

represent a pair of nodes given as the
i
-th query.
Output
For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.
