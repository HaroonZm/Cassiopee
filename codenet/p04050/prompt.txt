Problem Statement
Snuke got a present from his mother on his birthday.
The present was a pair of two sequences
a
and
b
, consisting of positive integers.
They satisfied all of the following properties:
The sum of all elements of
a
is
N
.
The sum of all elements of
b
is
N
.
Any string of length
N
that satisfies the following two conditions (1) and (2) will also satisfy the condition (3).
(1)
Any of the following forms a palindrome: the first
a_1
letters, the following
a_2
letters, the following
a_3
letters and so on.
(2)
Any of the following forms a palindrome: the first
b_1
letters, the following
b_2
letters, the following
b_3
letters and so on.
(3)
All
N
letters are the same.
He was happy, until one day he lost both of the sequences.
Now, he only remembers that the sequence
a
was a permutation of another sequence
A
of length
M
.
To bring him happiness again, his mother has decided to give him another pair of sequences
a
and
b
that satisfies his favorite properties and is consistent with his memory.
Constraints
1≦N≦10^5
1≦M≦100
1≦A_i≦10^5
The sum of all
A_i
equals
N
.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
M
A_1
A_2
...
A_M
Output
If there exists a pair of sequences
a
and
b
that satisfies the properties and is consistent with Snuke's memory, print three lines. The first line must contain the sequence
a
, the second line must contain the length of the sequence
b
, and the third line must contain the sequence
b
.
If such a pair does not exist (because Snuke's memory is wrong or some other reason), print a single line containing the word
Impossible
(case-sensitive).
