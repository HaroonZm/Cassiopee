Problem Statement
CODE FESTIVAL 2016 is going to be held. For the occasion, Mr. Takahashi decided to make a signboard.
He intended to write
CODEFESTIVAL2016
on it, but he mistakenly wrote a different string
S
. Fortunately, the string he wrote was the correct length.
So Mr. Takahashi decided to perform an operation that replaces a certain character with another in the minimum number of iterations, changing the string to
CODEFESTIVAL2016
.
Find the minimum number of iterations for the rewrite operation.
Constraints
S
is
16
characters long.
S
consists of uppercase and lowercase alphabet letters and numerals.
Input
Inputs are provided from Standard Input in the following form.
S
Output
Output an integer representing the minimum number of iterations needed for the rewrite operation.
Sample Input 1
C0DEFESTIVAL2O16
Sample Output 1
2
The second character
0
must be changed to
O
and the
14
th character
O
changed to
0
.
Sample Input 2
FESTIVAL2016CODE
Sample Output 2
