Voici un énoncé de problème :

Is-Convex
For a given polygon
g
, print "1" if
g
is a convex polygon, "0" otherwise. Here, in a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees.
g
is represented by a sequence of points
p
1
,
p
2
,...,
p
n
where line segments connecting
p
i
and
p
i+1
(1 ≤
i
≤
n-1
) are sides of the polygon. The line segment connecting
p
n
and
p
1
is also a side of the polygon.
Input
g
is given by coordinates of the points
p
1
,...,
p
n
in the following format:
n
x
1
y
1
x
2
y
2
:
x
n
y
n
The first integer
n
is the number of points. The coordinate of a point
p
i
is given by two integers
x
i
and
y
i
. The coordinates of points are given in the order of counter-clockwise visit of them.
Output
Print "1" or "0" in a line.
Constraints
3 ≤
n
≤ 100
-10000 ≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤ 10000
No point of the polygon will occur more than once.
Two sides of the polygon can intersect only at a common endpoint.
