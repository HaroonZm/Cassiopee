Problem Statement
There are
N
people, conveniently numbered
1
through
N
.
They were standing in a row yesterday, but now they are unsure of the order in which they were standing.
However, each person remembered the following fact: the absolute difference of the number of the people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of the people who were standing to the right of that person.
According to their reports, the difference above for person
i
is
A_i
.
Based on these reports, find the number of the possible orders in which they were standing.
Since it can be extremely large, print the answer modulo
10^9+7
.
Note that the reports may be incorrect and thus there may be no consistent order.
In such a case, print
0
.
Constraints
1≦N≦10^5
0≦A_i≦N-1
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1
A_2
...
A_N
Output
Print the number of the possible orders in which they were standing, modulo
10^9+7
.
Sample Input 1
5
2 4 4 0 2
Sample Output 1
4
There are four possible orders, as follows:
2,1,4,5,3
2,5,4,1,3
3,1,4,5,2
3,5,4,1,2
Sample Input 2
7
6 4 0 2 4 0 2
Sample Output 2
0
Any order would be inconsistent with the reports, thus the answer is
0
.
Sample Input 3
8
7 5 1 1 7 3 5 3
Sample Output 3
16


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
import sys
import copy
from collections import deque
stdin = sys.stdin

mod = 10**9+7

ni = lambda: int(ns())
na = lambda: list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
ns = lambda: stdin.readline().rstrip()  # ignore trailing spaces

n = ni()
a_list = na()

c = {abs((n-1-i)-i): 0 for i in range(n//2 + 1)}

for a in a_list:
    if a not in c or c[a]==2:
        print(0)
        exit(0)
    c[a] += 1

cnt = 1
for k,v in c.items():
    if v==2 or k==0:
        cnt *= v
        cnt %= mod
    else:
        print(0)
        exit(0)

print(cnt)
```
