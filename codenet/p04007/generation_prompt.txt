Problem Statement
Snuke and Ciel went to a strange stationery store. Each of them got a transparent graph paper with
H
rows and
W
columns.
Snuke painted some of the cells red in his paper. Here, the cells painted red were
4-connected
, that is, it was possible to traverse from any red cell to any other red cell, by moving to vertically or horizontally adjacent red cells only.
Ciel painted some of the cells blue in her paper. Here, the cells painted blue were 4-connected.
Afterwards, they precisely overlaid the two sheets in the same direction. Then, the intersection of the red cells and the blue cells appeared purple.
You are given a matrix of letters
a_{ij}
(
1≤i≤H
,
1≤j≤W
) that describes the positions of the purple cells. If the cell at the
i
-th row and
j
-th column is purple, then
a_{ij}
is
#
, otherwise
a_{ij}
is
.
. Here, it is guaranteed that
no outermost cell is purple
. That is, if
i=1, H
or
j = 1, W
, then
a_{ij}
is
.
.
Find a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation described. It can be shown that a solution always exists.
Constraints
3≤H,W≤500
a_{ij}
is
#
or
.
.
If
i=1,H
or
j=1,W
, then
a_{ij}
is
.
.
At least one of
a_{ij}
is
#
.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H
W
a_{11}
...
a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}
...
a_{HW}
Output
Print a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation, as follows:
The first
H
lines should describe the positions of the red cells.
The following
1
line should be empty.
The following
H
lines should describe the positions of the blue cells.
The description of the positions of the red or blue cells should follow the format of the description of the positions of the purple cells.
