Maximum Profit
You can obtain profits from foreign exchange margin transactions. For example, if you buy 1000 dollar at a rate of 100 yen per dollar, and sell them at a rate of 108 yen per dollar, you can obtain (108 - 100) × 1000 = 8000 yen.
Write a program which reads values of a currency $R_t$ at a certain time $t$ ($t = 0, 1, 2, ... n-1$), and reports the maximum value of $R_j - R_i$ where $j > i$ .
Input
The first line contains an integer $n$. In the following $n$ lines, $R_t$ ($t = 0, 1, 2, ... n-1$) are given in order.
Output
Print the maximum value in a line.
Constraints
$2 \leq n \leq 200,000$
$1 \leq R_t \leq 10^9$
