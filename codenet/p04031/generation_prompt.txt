Problem Statement
Evi has
N
integers
a_1,a_2,..,a_N
. His objective is to have
N
equal
integers
by transforming some of them.
He may transform each integer at most once. Transforming an integer
x
into another integer
y
costs him
(x-y)^2
dollars. Even if
a_i=a_j (i≠j)
, he has to pay the cost separately for transforming each of them (See Sample 2).
Find the minimum total cost to achieve his objective.
Constraints
1≦N≦100
-100≦a_i≦100
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1
a_2
...
a_N
Output
Print the minimum total cost to achieve Evi's objective.
Sample Input 1
2
4 8
Sample Output 1
8
Transforming the both into
6
s will cost
(4-6)^2+(8-6)^2=8
dollars, which is the minimum.
Sample Input 2
3
1 1 3
Sample Output 2
3
Transforming the all into
2
s will cost
(1-2)^2+(1-2)^2+(3-2)^2=3
dollars. Note that Evi has to pay
(1-2)^2
dollar separately for transforming each of the two
1
s.
Sample Input 3
3
4 2 5
Sample Output 3
5
Leaving the
4
as it is and transforming the
2
and the
5
into
4
s will achieve the total cost of
(2-4)^2+(5-4)^2=5
dollars, which is the minimum.
Sample Input 4
4
-100 -100 -100 -100
Sample Output 4
0
Without transforming anything, Evi's objective is already achieved. Thus, the necessary cost is
0
.


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
N,*a = open(0).read().split()

N=int(N)

list1=list(map(int,a))

#print(N)

#print(list1)

a=[]

for i in range(-100,101):
    int1=0
    for n in range(N):
        x = (list1[n]-i)
        y = x**2
        int1+=y
        if n==N-1:
            a.append(int1)
    
#print(a)

#print(max(a))

print(min(a))
