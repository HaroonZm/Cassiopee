Problem Statement
We held two competitions: Coding Contest and Robot Maneuver.
In each competition, the contestants taking the
3
-rd,
2
-nd, and
1
-st places receive
100000
,
200000
, and
300000
yen (the currency of Japan), respectively. Furthermore, a contestant taking the first place in both competitions receives an additional
400000
yen.
DISCO-Kun took the
X
-th place in Coding Contest and the
Y
-th place in Robot Maneuver.
Find the total amount of money he earned.
Constraints
1 \leq X \leq 205
1 \leq Y \leq 205
X
and
Y
are integers.
Input

Output
Print the amount of money DISCO-Kun earned, as an integer.
Sample Input 1
1 1
Sample Output 1
1000000
In this case, he earned
300000
yen in Coding Contest and another
300000
yen in Robot Maneuver. Furthermore, as he won both competitions, he got an additional
400000
yen.
In total, he made
300000 + 300000 + 400000 = 1000000
yen.
Sample Input 2

Sample Output 2
100000
In this case, he earned
100000
yen in Coding Contest.
Sample Input 3

In this case, unfortunately, he was the highest-ranked contestant without prize money in both competitions.


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
X, Y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
prize = 0

prize_list = {1:300000, 2:200000, 3:100000}

if X > 0 and X < 4:
    prize += prize_list[X]

if Y > 0 and Y < 4:
    prize += prize_list[Y]

if prize == 600000:
    prize = 1000000

print(prize)
```
