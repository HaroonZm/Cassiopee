Problem
Ebi-chan has
N
formulae:
y = a_i x
for
i =1, ..., N
(inclusive). Now she considers a subsequence of indices with length
k
:
s_1
,
s_2
,
...
,
s_k
. At first, let
x_0
be
1
and evaluate
s_1
-th formulae with
x = x_0
. Next, let
x_1
be the output of
s_1
and evaluate
s_2
-th formulae with
x = x_1
, and so on.
She wants to maximize the final output of the procedure,
x_{s_k}
. If there are many candidates, she wants the """shortest one""". If there are still many candidates, she wants the """lexicographically smallest one""".
Sequence
s
is lexicographically smaller than sequence
t
, if and only if either of the following conditions hold:
there exists
m < |s|
such that
s_i = t_i
for
i
in
1
to
m
(inclusive) and
s_{m+1} < t_{m+1}
, or
s_i = t_i
for
i
in
1
to
|s|
(inclusive) and
|s| < |t|
,
where
|s|
is the length of the
s
.
Input
N
a_1
a_2
$\cdots$
a_N
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 60
-2 \leq a_i \leq 2
for
i=1, ...,N
(inclusive)
Every input is given as the integer.
Output
Output
k+1
lines. First line, the length of the sequence,
k
. Following
k
lines, the index of the
i
-th element of the subsequence,
s_i
(one element per line).
Sample Input 1
4
2 0 -2 1
Sample Output for Input 1
1
1
She evaluates the first one and gets the maximum value
2
.
Sample Input 2
3
2 -2 -2
Sample Output for Input 2
3
1
2
3
She evaluates all of them and gets the maximum value
8
.
Sample Input 3
2
-1 0
Sample Output for Input 3
0
She evaluates none of them and gets the maximum value
0
. Empty sequence is the shorter and lexicographically smaller than any other sequences.
Sample Input 4
5
-1 2 1 -2 -1
Sample Output for Input 4
3
1
2
4
She evaluates $\langle$
1, 2, 4
$\rangle$ ones and gets the maximum value
4
. Note that $\langle$
2, 4, 5
$\rangle$ is not lexicographically smallest one.
