Problem Statement
We have an
H
-by-
W
matrix.
Let
a_{ij}
be the element at the
i
-th row from the top and
j
-th column from the left.
In this matrix, each
a_{ij}
is a lowercase English letter.
Snuke is creating another
H
-by-
W
matrix,
A'
, by freely rearranging the elements in
A
.
Here, he wants to satisfy the following condition:
Every row and column in
A'
can be read as a palindrome.
Determine whether he can create a matrix satisfying the condition.
Note
A
palindrome
is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
For example,
a
,
aa
,
abba
and
abcba
are all palindromes, while
ab
,
abab
and
abcda
are not.
Constraints
1 ≤ H, W ≤ 100
a_{ij}
is a lowercase English letter.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H
W
a_{11}
a_{12}
...
a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}
a_{H2}
...
a_{HW}
Output
If Snuke can create a matrix satisfying the condition, print
Yes
; otherwise, print
No
.
Sample Input 1
3 4
aabb
aabb
aacc
Sample Output 1
Yes
For example, the following matrix satisfies the condition.
abba
acca
abba
Sample Input 2
2 2
aa
bb
Sample Output 2
No
It is not possible to create a matrix satisfying the condition, no matter how we rearrange the elements in
A
.
