Problem Statement
Snuke loves permutations. He is making a permutation of length
N
.
Since he hates the integer
K
, his permutation will satisfy the following:
Let the permutation be
a_1, a_2, ..., a_N
. For each
i = 1,2,...,N
,
|a_i - i| \neq K
.
Among the
N!
permutations of length
N
, how many satisfies this condition?
Since the answer may be extremely large, find the answer modulo
924844033
(prime).
Constraints
