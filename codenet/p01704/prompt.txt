Problem Statement
We have planted $N$ flower seeds, all of which come into different flowers.
We want to make all the flowers come out together.
Each plant has a value called vitality, which is initially zero.
Watering and spreading fertilizers cause changes on it, and the $i$-th plant will come into flower if its vitality is equal to or greater than $\mathit{th}_i$.
Note that $\mathit{th}_i$ may be negative because some flowers require no additional nutrition.
Watering effects on all the plants.
Watering the plants with $W$ liters of water changes the vitality of the $i$-th plant by $W \times \mathit{vw}_i$ for all $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), and costs $W \times \mathit{pw}$ yen, where $W$ need not be an integer.
$\mathit{vw}_i$ may be negative because some flowers hate water.
We have $N$ kinds of fertilizers, and the $i$-th fertilizer effects only on the $i$-th plant.
Spreading $F_i$ kilograms of the $i$-th fertilizer changes the vitality of the $i$-th plant by $F_i \times \mathit{vf}_i$, and costs $F_i \times \mathit{pf}_i$ yen, where $F_i$ need not be an integer as well.
Each fertilizer is specially made for the corresponding plant, therefore $\mathit{vf}_i$ is guaranteed to be positive.
Of course, we also want to minimize the cost.
Formally, our purpose is described as "to minimize $W \times \mathit{pw} + \sum_{i=1}^{N}(F_i \times \mathit{pf}_i)$ under $W \times \mathit{vw}_i + F_i \times \mathit{vf}_i \ge \mathit{th}_i$, $W \ge 0$, and $F_i \ge 0$ for all $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$)".
Your task is to calculate the minimum cost.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets.
The number of datasets does not exceed $100$, and the data size of the input does not exceed $20\mathrm{MB}$.
Each dataset is formatted as follows.
$N$
$\mathit{pw}$
$\mathit{vw}_1$ $\mathit{pf}_1$ $\mathit{vf}_1$ $\mathit{th}_1$
:
:
$\mathit{vw}_N$ $\mathit{pf}_N$ $\mathit{vf}_N$ $\mathit{th}_N$
The first line of a dataset contains a single integer $N$, number of flower seeds.
The second line of a dataset contains a single integer $\mathit{pw}$, cost of watering one liter.
Each of the following $N$ lines describes a flower. The $i$-th line contains four integers, $\mathit{vw}_i$, $\mathit{pf}_i$, $\mathit{vf}_i$, and $\mathit{th}_i$, separated by a space.
You can assume that $1 \le N \le 10^5$, $1 \le \mathit{pw} \le 100$, $-100 \le \mathit{vw}_i \le 100$, $1 \le \mathit{pf}_i \le 100$, $1 \le \mathit{vf}_i \le 100$, and $-100 \le \mathit{th}_i \le 100$.
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a zero.
Output
For each dataset, output a line containing the minimum cost to make all the flowers come out.
The output must have an absolute or relative error at most $10^{-4}$.
