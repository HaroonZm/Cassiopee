C - Decoding Ancient Messages
Problem Statement
Professor Y's work is to dig up ancient artifacts. Recently, he found a lot of strange stone plates, each of which has $N^2$ characters arranged in an $N \times N$ matrix. Further research revealed that each plate represents a message of length $N$. Also, the procedure to decode the message from a plate was turned out to be the following:
Select $N$ characters from the plate one by one so that any two characters are neither in the same row nor in the same column.
Create a string by concatenating the selected characters.
Among all possible strings obtained by the above steps, find the lexicographically smallest one. It is the message represented by this plate.
NOTE: The order of the characters is defined as the same as the order of their ASCII values (that is, $\mathtt{A} \lt \mathtt{B} \lt \cdots \lt \mathtt{Z} \lt \mathtt{a} \lt \mathtt{b} \lt \cdots \lt \mathtt{z}$).
After struggling with the plates, Professor Y gave up decoding messages by hand. You, a great programmer and Y's old friend, was asked for a help. Your task is to write a program to decode the messages hidden in the plates.
Input
The input is formated as follows:
$N$
$c_{11} c_{12} \cdots c_{1N}$
$c_{21} c_{22} \cdots c_{2N}$
:
:
$c_{N1} c_{N2} \cdots c_{NN}$
The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 50$). Each of the subsequent $N$ lines contains a string of $N$ characters. Each character in the string is an uppercase or lowercase English letter (
A
-
Z
,
a
-
z
).
Output
Print the message represented by the plate in a line.
