Problem Statement
You are given a forest with
N
vertices and
M
edges. The vertices are numbered
0
through
N-1
.
The edges are given in the format
(x_i,y_i)
, which means that Vertex
x_i
and
y_i
are connected by an edge.
Each vertex
i
has a value
a_i
.
You want to add edges in the given forest so that the forest becomes connected.
To add an edge, you choose two different vertices
i
and
j
, then span an edge between
i
and
j
.
This operation costs
a_i + a_j
dollars, and afterward neither Vertex
i
nor
j
can be selected again.
Find the minimum total cost required to make the forest connected, or print
Impossible
if it is impossible.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
0 ≤ M ≤ N-1
1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ x_i,y_i ≤ N-1
The given graph is a forest.
All input values are integers.

If we connect vertices
0
and
5
, the graph becomes connected, for the cost of
1 + 6 = 7
dollars.

Sample Output 2
Impossible
We can't make the graph connected.

Sample Output 3
0
The graph is already connected, so we do not need to add any edges.
