Voici un énoncé de problème :

Bridges
Find bridges of an undirected graph
G(V, E)
.
A bridge (also known as a cut-edge) is an edge whose deletion increase the number of connected components.
Input
|V|
|E|
s
0
t
0
s
1
t
1
:
s
|E|-1
t
|E|-1
, where
|V|
is the number of nodes and
|E|
is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,...,
|V|
-1 respectively.
s
i
and
t
i
represent source and target nodes of
i
-th edge (undirected).
Output
A list of
bridges
of the graph ordered by name. For each bridge, names of its end-ponints, source and target (source < target), should be printed separated by a space. The sources should be printed ascending order, then the target should also be printed ascending order for the same source.
Constraints
1 ≤
|V|
≤ 100,000
0 ≤
|E|
≤ 100,000
The graph is connected
There are no parallel edges
There are no self-loops
