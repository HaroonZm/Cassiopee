Problem A:
Rational Irrationals
Rational numbers are numbers represented by ratios of two integers. For a prime number
p
, one of the elementary theorems in the number theory is that there is no rational number equal to √
p
. Such numbers are called irrational numbers. It is also known that there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to √
p
Now, given a positive integer
n
, we define a set
Q
n
of all rational numbers whose elements are represented by ratios of two positive integers both of which are less than or equal to
n
. For example,
Q
4
is a set of 11 rational numbers {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/1, 2/3, 3/1, 3/2, 3/4, 4/1, 4/3}. 2/2, 2/4, 3/3, 4/2 and 4/4 are not included here because they are equal to 1/1, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1 and 1/1, respectively.
Your job is to write a program that reads two integers
p
and
n
and reports two rational numbers
x / y
and
u / v
, where
u / v
< √
p
<
x / y
and there are no other elements of
Q
n
between
u/v
and
x/y
. When
n
is greater than √
p
, such a pair of rational numbers always exists.
Input
The input consists of lines each of which contains two positive integers, a prime number
p
and an integer
n
in the following format.
p n
They are separated by a space character. You can assume that
p
and
n
are less than 10000, and that
n
is greater than √
p
. The end of the input is indicated by a line consisting of two zeros.
Output
For each input line, your program should output a line consisting of the two rational numbers
x / y
and
u / v
(
x / y
>
u / v
) separated by a space character in the following format.
x/y u/v
They should be irreducible. For example, 6/14 and 15/3 are not accepted. They should be reduced to 3/7 and 5/1, respectively.
Sample Input
2 5
3 10
5 100
0 0
Output for the Sample Input
3/2 4/3
7/4 5/3
85/38 38/17
