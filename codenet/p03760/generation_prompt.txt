he took two notes: one contains the characters at the odd-numbered positions, and the other contains the characters at the even-numbered positions.
You are given two strings
O
and
E
.
O
contains the characters at the odd-numbered positions retaining their relative order, and
E
contains the characters at the even-numbered positions retaining their relative order.
Restore the original password.
Constraints

E
consists of lowercase English letters (

z
).
1 \leq |O|,|E| \leq 50
|O| - |E|

or
1
.

O
E
