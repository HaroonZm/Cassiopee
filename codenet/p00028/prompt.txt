Mode Value
Your task is to write a program which reads a sequence of integers and prints mode values of the sequence.
The mode value is the element which occurs most frequently.
Input
A sequence of integers
a
i
(1 ≤
a
i
≤ 100). The number of integers is less than or equals to 100.
Output
Print the mode values. If there are several mode values, print them in ascending order.
Sample Input
5
6
3
5
8
7
5
3
9
7
3
4
Output for the Sample Input
3
5
For example, 3 and 5 respectively occur three times, 7 occurs two times, and others occur only one. So, the mode values are 3 and 5.
