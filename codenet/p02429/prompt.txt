Enumeration of Subsets III
You are given a set $T$, which is a subset of $S$. The set $S$ consists of $0, 1, ... n-1$.
Print all subsets of $T$.
Note that we represent $0, 1, ... n-1$ as 00...0001, 00...0010, 00...0100, ..., 10...0000 in binary respectively and the integer representation of a subset is calculated by bitwise OR of existing elements.
Input
The input is given in the following format.
$n$
$k \; b_0 \; b_1 \; ... \; b_{k-1}$
$k$ is the number of elements in $T$, and $b_i$ represents elements in $T$.
Output
Print the subsets ordered by their decimal integers. Print a subset in the following format.
$d$: $e_0$ $e_1$ ...
Print '
:
' after the integer value $d$, then print elements $e_i$ in the subset in ascending order. Separate two adjacency elements by a space character.
Constraints
$1 \leq n \leq 28$
$0 \leq k \leq 18$
$k \leq n$
$0 \leq b_i < n$
