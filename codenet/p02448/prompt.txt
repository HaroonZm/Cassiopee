Voici un énoncé de problème :

Sorting Tuples
Write a program which reads $n$ items and sorts them. Each item has attributes $\{value, weight, type, date, name\}$ and they are represented by $\{$ integer, integer, upper-case letter, integer, string $\}$ respectively. Sort the items based on the following priorities.
first by value (ascending)
in case of a tie, by weight (ascending)
in case of a tie, by type (ascending in lexicographic order)
in case of a tie, by date (ascending)
in case of a tie, by name (ascending in lexicographic order)
Input
The input is given in the following format.
$n$
$v_0 \; w_0 \; t_0 \; d_0 \; s_0$
$v_1 \; w_1 \; t_1 \; d_1 \; s_1$
:
$v_{n-1} \; w_{n-1} \; t_{n-1} \; d_{n-1} \; s_{n-1}$
In the first line, the number of items $n$. In the following $n$ lines, attributes of each item are given. $v_i \; w_i \; t_i \; d_i \; s_i$ represent value, weight, type, date and name of the $i$-th item respectively.
Output
Print attributes of each item in order. Print an item in a line and adjacency attributes should be separated by a single space.
Constraints
$1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
$0 \leq v_i \leq 1,000,000,000$
$0 \leq w_i \leq 1,000,000,000$
$t_i$ is a upper-case letter
$0 \leq d_i \leq 2,000,000,000,000$
$1 \leq $ size of $s_i \leq 20$
$s_i \ne s_j$ if $(i \ne j)$
