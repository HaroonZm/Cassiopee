Problem Statement
You are given
N
non-negative integers
A_1, A_2, ..., A_N
and another non-negative integer
K
.
For a integer
X
between
0
and
K
(inclusive), let
f(X) = (X
XOR
A_1)
+
(X
XOR
A_2)
+
...
+
(X
XOR
A_N)
.
Here, for non-negative integers
a
and
b
,
a
XOR
b
denotes the bitwise exclusive OR of
a
and
b
.
Find the maximum value of
f
.
What is XOR?
The bitwise exclusive OR of
a
and
b
,
X
, is defined as follows:
When
X
is written in base two, the digit in the
2^k
's place (
k \geq 0
) is
1
if, when written in base two, exactly one of
A
and
B
has
1
in the
2^k
's place, and
0
otherwise.
For example,
3
XOR
5 = 6
. (When written in base two:
011
XOR
101 = 110
.)
