Voici un énoncé de problème :

Tax Rate Changed
VAT (value-added tax) is a tax imposed at a certain rate proportional to the sale price.
Our store uses the following rules to calculate the after-tax prices.
When the VAT rate is
x
%,
for an item with the before-tax price of
p
yen,
its after-tax price of the item is
p
(100+
x
) / 100 yen, fractions rounded off.
The total after-tax price of multiple items paid at once is
the sum of after-tax prices of the items.
The VAT rate is changed quite often.
Our accountant has become aware that
"different pairs of items that had the same total after-tax price
may have different total after-tax prices after VAT rate changes."
For example, when the VAT rate rises from 5% to 8%,
a pair of items that had the total after-tax prices of 105 yen before
can now have after-tax prices either of 107, 108, or 109 yen, as shown in the table below.
Before-tax prices of two items
After-tax price with 5% VAT
After-tax price with 8% VAT
20, 80
21 + 84 = 105
21 + 86 = 107
2, 99
2 + 103 = 105
2 + 106 = 108
13, 88
13 + 92 = 105
14 + 95 = 109
Our accountant is examining effects of VAT-rate changes on after-tax prices.
You are asked to write a program that calculates the possible maximum
total after-tax price of two items with the new VAT rate,
knowing their total after-tax price before the VAT rate change.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets.
Each dataset is in one line,
which consists of three integers
x
,
y
, and
s
separated by a space.
x
is the VAT rate in percent
before
the VAT-rate change,
y
is the VAT rate in percent
after
the VAT-rate change,
and
s
is the sum of after-tax prices of two items
before
the VAT-rate change.
For these integers, 0 <
x
< 100, 0 <
y
< 100,
10 <
s
< 1000, and
x
≠
y
hold.
For before-tax prices of items, all possibilities of 1 yen through
s
-1 yen should be considered.
The end of the input is specified by three zeros separated by a space.
Output
For each dataset,
output in a line the possible maximum total after-tax price when the VAT rate is changed to
y
%.

En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
def tax(p, x):
	return p * (100 + x) // 100

while True:
	x, y, s = map(int, input().split())
	if x == y == s == 0:
		break
	m = 0
	for i in range(1, s):
		for j in range(1, s):
			t = tax(i, x) + tax(j, x)
			if t > s:
				break
			if (t) == s:
				m = max(m, tax(i, y) + tax(j, y))
	print(m)
