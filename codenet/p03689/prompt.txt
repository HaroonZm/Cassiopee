Problem Statement
You are given four integers:
H
,
W
,
h
and
w
(
1 ≤ h ≤ H
,
1 ≤ w ≤ W
).
Determine whether there exists a matrix such that all of the following conditions are held, and construct one such matrix if the answer is positive:
The matrix has
H
rows and
W
columns.
Each element of the matrix is an integer between
-10^9
and
10^9
(inclusive).
The sum of all the elements of the matrix is positive.
The sum of all the elements within every subrectangle with
h
rows and
w
columns in the matrix is negative.
Constraints
1 ≤ h ≤ H ≤ 500
1 ≤ w ≤ W ≤ 500
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H
W
h
w
Output
If there does not exist a matrix that satisfies all of the conditions, print
No
.
Otherwise, print
Yes
in the first line, and print a matrix in the subsequent lines in the following format:
a_{11}
...
a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}
...
a_{HW}
Here,
a_{ij}
represents the
(i,\ j)
element of the matrix.

The sum of all the elements of this matrix is
4
, which is positive.
Also, in this matrix, there are four subrectangles with
2
rows and
2
columns as shown below. For each of them, the sum of all the elements inside is
-1
, which is negative.
