Problem Statement
Construct a sequence
a
= {
a_1,\ a_2,\ ...,\ a_{2^{M + 1}}
} of length
2^{M + 1}
that satisfies the following conditions, if such a sequence exists.
Each integer between
0
and
2^M - 1
(inclusive) occurs twice in
a
.
For any
i
and
j
(i < j)
such that
a_i = a_j
, the formula
a_i \ xor \ a_{i + 1} \ xor \ ... \ xor \ a_j = K
holds.
What is xor (bitwise exclusive or)?
The xor of integers
c_1, c_2, ..., c_n
is defined as follows:
When
c_1 \ xor \ c_2 \ xor \ ... \ xor \ c_n
is written in base two, the digit in the
2^k
's place (
k \geq 0
) is
1
if the number of integers among
c_1, c_2, ...c_m
whose binary representations have
1
in the
2^k
's place is odd, and
0
if that count is even.
For example,
3 \ xor \ 5 = 6
. (If we write it in base two:
011
xor
101
=
110
.)
