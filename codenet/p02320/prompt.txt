Knapsack Problem with Limitations
You have
N
items that you want to put them into a knapsack. Item
i
has value
v
i
, weight
w
i
and limitation
m
i
.
You want to find a subset of items to put such that:
The total value of the items is as large as possible.
The items have combined weight at most
W
, that is capacity of the knapsack.
You can select at most
m
i
items for
i
th item.
Find the maximum total value of items in the knapsack.
