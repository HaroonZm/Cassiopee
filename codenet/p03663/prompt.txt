Problem Statement
This is an interactive task.
Snuke has a favorite positive integer,
N
. You can ask him the following type of question at most
64
times: "Is
n
your favorite integer?" Identify
N
.
Snuke is twisted, and when asked "Is
n
your favorite integer?", he answers "Yes" if one of the two conditions below is satisfied, and answers "No" otherwise:
Both
n \leq N
and
str(n) \leq str(N)
hold.
Both
n > N
and
str(n) > str(N)
hold.
Here,
str(x)
is the decimal representation of
x
(without leading zeros) as a string. For example,
str(123) =
123
and
str(2000)
=
2000
.
Strings are compared lexicographically. For example,
11111
<
123
and
123456789
<
9
.
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 10^{9}
Input and Output
Write your question to Standard Output in the following format:
?
n
Here,
n
must be an integer between
1
and
10^{18}
(inclusive).
Then, the response to the question shall be given from Standard Input in the following format:
ans
Here,
ans
is either
Y
or
N
.
Y
represents "Yes";
N
represents "No".
Finally, write your answer in the following format:
!
n
Here,
n=N
must hold.
Judging
After each output, you must flush Standard Output.
Otherwise you may get
TLE
.
After you print the answer, the program must be terminated immediately. Otherwise, the behavior of the judge is undefined.
When your output is invalid or incorrect, the behavior of the judge is undefined (it does not necessarily give
WA
).
Sample
Below is a sample communication for the case
N=123
:
Input
Output
? 1
Y
? 32
N
? 1010
N
? 999
Y
! 123
Since
1 \leq 123
and
str(1) \leq str(123)
, the first response is "Yes".
Since
32 \leq 123
but
str(32) > str(123)
, the second response is "No".
Since
1010 > 123
but
str(1010) \leq str(123)
, the third response is "No".
Since
999 \geq 123
and
str(999) > str(123)
, the fourth response is "Yes".
The program successfully identifies
N=123
in four questions, and thus passes the case.
