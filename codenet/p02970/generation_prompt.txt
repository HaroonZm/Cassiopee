Problem Statement
There are
N
apple trees in a row. People say that one of them will bear golden apples.
We want to deploy some number of inspectors so that each of these trees will be inspected.
Each inspector will be deployed under one of the trees. For convenience, we will assign numbers from
1
through
N
to the trees. An inspector deployed under the
i
-th tree
(1 \leq i \leq N)
will inspect the trees with numbers between
i-D
and
i+D
(inclusive).
Find the minimum number of inspectors that we need to deploy to achieve the objective.
Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 \leq N \leq 20
1 \leq D \leq 20
