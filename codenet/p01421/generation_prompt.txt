Voici un énoncé de problème :

Reverse Roads
ICP city has an express company whose trucks run from the crossing
S
to the crossing
T
.
The president of the company is feeling upset because all the roads in the city are one-way, and are severely congested.
So, he planned to improve the maximum flow (edge disjoint paths) from the crossing
S
to the crossing
T
by reversing the traffic direction on some of the roads.
Your task is writing a program to calculate the maximized flow from
S
to
T
by reversing some roads, and the list of the reversed roads.
Input
The first line of a data set contains two integers
N
(
2 \leq N \leq 300
) and
M
(
0 \leq M \leq {\rm min} (1\,000,\ N(N-1)/2)
).
N
is the number of crossings in the city and
M
is the number of roads.
The following
M
lines describe one-way roads in the city.
The
i
-th line (
1
-based) contains two integers
X_i
and
Y_i
(
1 \leq X_i, Y_i \leq N
,
X_i \neq Y_i
).
X_i
is the ID number (
1
-based) of the starting point of the
i
-th road and
Y_i
is that of the terminal point.
The last line contains two integers
S
and
T
(
1 \leq S, T \leq N
,
S \neq T
,
1
-based).
The capacity of each road is
1
.
You can assume that
i \neq j
implies either
X_i \neq X_j
or
Y_i \neq Y_j
,
and either
X_i \neq Y_j
or
X_j \neq Y_i
.
Output
In the first line, print the maximized flow by reversing some roads.
In the second line, print the number
R
of the reversed roads.
In each of the following
R
lines, print the ID number (
1
-based) of a reversed road.
You may not print the same ID number more than once.
If there are multiple answers which would give us the same flow capacity, you can print any of them.
