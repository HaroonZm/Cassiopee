Problem Statement
You are an immigration officer in the Kingdom of AtCoder. The document carried by an immigrant has some number of integers written on it, and you need to check whether they meet certain criteria.
According to the regulation, the immigrant should be allowed entry to the kingdom if and only if the following condition is satisfied:
All even numbers written on the document are divisible by
3
or
5
.
If the immigrant should be allowed entry according to the regulation, output
APPROVED
; otherwise, print
DENIED
.
Notes
The condition in the statement can be rephrased as "If
x
is an even number written on the document,
x
is divisible by
3
or
5
".
Here "
if
" and "
or
" are logical terms.
Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 \leq N \leq 100
1 \leq A_i \leq 1000
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1
A_2
\dots
A_N
Output
If the immigrant should be allowed entry according to the regulation, print
APPROVED
; otherwise, print
DENIED
.
Sample Input 1
5
6 7 9 10 31
Sample Output 1
APPROVED
The even numbers written on the document are
6
and
10
.
All of them are divisible by
3
or
5
, so the immigrant should be allowed entry.
Sample Input 2
3
28 27 24
Sample Output 2
DENIED
28
violates the condition, so the immigrant should not be allowed entry.


En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
N = int(input())
A = map(int, input().split())

cnt = 0
for a in A:
    if a % 2 == 0:
        if a % 3 == 0:
            cnt += 1
        elif a % 5 == 0:
            cnt += 1
    else:
        cnt += 1
print('APPROVED' if N == cnt else 'DENIED')
```
