Problem Statement
One day Mr. Takahashi picked up a dictionary containing all of the
N
! permutations of integers
1
through
N
.
The dictionary has
N
! pages, and page
i
(
1 ≤ i ≤ N!
) contains the
i
-th permutation in the lexicographical order.
Mr. Takahashi wanted to look up a certain permutation of length
N
in this dictionary, but he forgot some part of it.
His memory of the permutation is described by a sequence
P_1, P_2, ..., P_N
.
If
P_i = 0
, it means that he forgot the
i
-th element of the permutation; otherwise, it means that he remembered the
i
-th element of the permutation and it is
P_i
.
He decided to look up all the possible permutations in the dictionary.
Compute the sum of the page numbers of the pages he has to check, modulo
10^9 + 7
.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 500000
0 ≤ P_i ≤ N
P_i ≠ P_j
if
i ≠ j
(
1 ≤ i, j ≤ N
),
P_i ≠ 0
and
P_j ≠ 0
.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
P_1
P_2
...
P_N
Output
Print the sum of the page numbers of the pages he has to check, as modulo
10^9 + 7
.

The possible permutations are [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
] and [
4
,
2
,
3
,
1
].
Since the former is on page
1
and the latter is on page
22
, the answer is
23
.

Sample Output 2
21
Since all permutations of length
3
are possible, the answer is
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
.
