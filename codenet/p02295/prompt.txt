Voici un énoncé de problème :

Cross Point
For given two segments
s1
and
s2
, print the coordinate of the cross point of them.
s1
is formed by end points
p0
and
p1
, and
s2
is formed by end points
p2
and
p3
.
Input
The entire input looks like:
q
(the number of queries)
1st query
2nd query
...
q
th query
Each query consists of integer coordinates of end points of
s1
and
s2
in the following format:
x
p0
y
p0
x
p1
y
p1
x
p2
y
p2

p3
y
p3
Output
For each query, print the coordinate of the cross point. The output values should be in a decimal fraction with an error less than 0.00000001.
Constraints
