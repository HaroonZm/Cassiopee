Range Query on a Tree II
Write a program which manipulates a weighted rooted tree $T$ with the following operations:
$add(v,w)$: add $w$ to all edges from the root to node $u$
$getSum(u)$: report the sum of weights of all edges from the root to node $u$
The given tree $T$ consists of $n$ nodes and every node has a unique ID from $0$ to $n-1$ respectively where ID of the root is $0$.
Note that all weights are initialized to zero.
Input
The input is given in the following format.
$n$
$node_0$
$node_1$
$node_2$
$:$
$node_{n-1}$
$q$
$query_1$
$query_2$
$:$
$query_{q}$
The first line of the input includes an integer $n$, the number of nodes in the tree.
In the next $n$ lines,the information of node $i$ is given in the following format:
k
i
c
1
c
2
...
c
k
$k_i$ is the number of children of node $i$, and $c_1$ $c_2$ ... $c_{k_i}$ are node IDs of 1st, ... $k$th child of node $i$.
In the next line, the number of queries $q$ is given. In the next $q$ lines, $i$th query is given in the following format:
0
v
w
or
1
u
The first integer represents the type of queries.'0' denotes $add(v, w)$ and '1' denotes $getSum(u)$.
Constraints
All the inputs are given in integers
$ 2 \leq n \leq 100000 $
$ c_j < c_{j+1} $ $( 1 \leq j \leq k-1 )$
$ 2 \leq q \leq 200000 $
$ 1 \leq u,v \leq n-1 $
$ 1 \leq w \leq 10000 $
Output
For each $getSum$ query, print the sum in a line.
