Network Reliability
An undirected graph is given.
Each edge of the graph disappears with a constant probability.
Calculate the probability with which the remained graph is connected.
Input
The first line contains three integers
N
(
1 \leq N \leq 14
),
M
(
0 \leq M \leq 100
) and
P
(
0 \leq P \leq 100
), separated by a single space.
N
is the number of the vertices and
M
is the number of the edges.
P
is the probability represented by a percentage.
The following
M
lines describe the edges.
Each line contains two integers
v_i
and
u_i
(
1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq N
).
(
u_i, v_i
) indicates the edge that connects the two vertices
u_i
and
v_i
.
Output
Output a line containing the probability with which the remained graph is connected.
Your program may output an arbitrary number of digits after the decimal point. However, the absolute error should be
10^{-9}
or less.
