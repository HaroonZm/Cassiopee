Voici un énoncé de problème :

Sum of 4 Integers
Write a program which reads an integer
n
and identifies the number of combinations of
a, b, c
and
d
(0 ≤
a, b, c, d
≤ 9) which meet the following equality:
a + b + c + d = n
For example, for
n
= 35, we have 4 different combinations of (
a, b, c, d
): (
8, 9, 9, 9
), (
9, 8, 9, 9
), (
9, 9, 8, 9
), and (
9, 9, 9, 8
).
Input
The input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of
n
(1 ≤
n
≤ 50) in a line. The number of datasets is less than or equal to 50.
Output
Print the number of combination in a line.
Sample Input
