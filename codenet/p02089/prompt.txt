Problem Statement
You have an array
A
of
N
integers.
A_i
denotes the
i
-th element of
A
.
You have to process one of the following queries
Q
times:
Query 1: The query consists of non-negative integer
x
, and two positive integers
s, t
. For all the elements
greater
than or equal to
x
in
A
, you have to add
s
to the elements, and then multiply them by
t
. That is, an element with
v (v \geq x)
becomes
t(v + s)
after this query.
Query 2: The query consists of non-negative integer
x
, and two positive integers
s, t
. For all the elements
less
than or equal to
x
in
A
, you have to subtract
s
from the elements, and then divide them by
t
. If the result is not an integer, you truncate it towards zero. That is, an element with
v (v \leq x)
becomes $\mathrm{trunc}$
( \frac{v - s}{t} )
after this query, where $\mathrm{trunc}$
( y )
is the integer obtained by truncating
y
towards zero.
"Truncating towards zero" means converting a decimal number to an integer so that if
x = 0.0
then
0
, otherwise an integer whose absolute value is the maximum integer no more than
|x|
and whose sign is same as
x
. For example, truncating
3.5
towards zero is
3
, and truncating
-2.8
towards zero is
-2
.
After applying
Q
queries one by one, how many elements in
A
are no less than
L
and no more than
R
?

The first line contains four integers
N
,
Q
,
L
, and
R
.
N
is the number of elements in an integer array
A
,
Q
is the number of queries, and
L
and
R
specify the range of integers you want to count within after the queries.
The second line consists of
N
integers, the
i
-th of which is the
i
-th element of
A
.
The following
Q
lines represent information of queries. The
j
-th line of them corresponds to the
j
-th query and consists of four integers
q_j
,
x_j
,
s_j
, and
t_j
. Here,
q_j = 1
stands for the
j
-th query is Query 1, and
q_j = 2
stands for the
j
-th query is Query 2.
x_j
,
s_j
, and
t_j
are parameters used for the
j
-th query.
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
-2^{63} < L \leq R < 2^{63}
0 \leq |A_i| \leq 10^9
q_j \in \{ 1, 2 \}
0 \leq x_j < 2^{63}
1 \leq s_j, t_j \leq 10^9
Inputs consist only of integers.
The absolute value of any element in the array dosen't exceed
2^{63}
at any point during query processing.
Output
Output the number of elements in
A
that are no less than
L
and no more than
R
after processing all given queries in one line.
