Problem Statement
There are
N
turkeys.
We number them from
1
through
N
.
M
men will visit here one by one.
The
i
-th man to visit will take the following action:
If both turkeys
x_i
and
y_i
are alive: selects one of them with equal probability, then eats it.
If either turkey
x_i
or
y_i
is alive (but not both): eats the alive one.
If neither turkey
x_i
nor
y_i
is alive: does nothing.
Find the number of pairs
(i,\ j)
(
1 ≤ i < j ≤ N
) such that the following condition is held:
The probability of both turkeys
i
and
j
being alive after all the men took actions, is greater than
0
.
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 400
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ x_i < y_i ≤ N
