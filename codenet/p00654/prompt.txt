Problem H: Squid Multiplication
Squid Eiko loves mathematics.
Especially she loves to think about integer.
One day, Eiko found a math problem from a website.
"A sequence
b
={
a
i
+
a
j
|
i
<
j
} is generated from a sequence
a
={
a
0
, ... ,
a
n
|
a
i
is even if
i
is 0, otherwise
a
i
is odd}. Given the sequence
b
, find the sequence
a
."
This problem is easy for Eiko and she feels boring. So, she made a new problem by modifying this problem .
"A sequence
b
={
a
i
*
a
j
|
i
<
j
} is generated from a sequence
a
={
a
0
, ... ,
a
n
|
a
i
is even if
i
is 0, otherwise
a
i
is odd}. Given the sequence
b
, find the sequence
a
."
Your task is to solve the problem made by Eiko.
Input
Input consists of multiple datasets.
Each dataset is given by following formats.
n
b
0
b
1
...
b
n*(n+1)/2-1
n
is the number of odd integers in the sequence
a
. The range of
n
is 2 ≤
n
≤ 250.
b
i
is separated by a space.
Each
b
i
is 1 ≤
b
i
≤ 2
63
-1.
The end of the input consists of a single 0.
Output
For each dataset, you should output two lines.
First line contains
a
0
, an even number in the sequence
a
.
The second line contains
n
odd elements separated by a space. The odd elements are sorted by increasing order.
You can assume that the result is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2
