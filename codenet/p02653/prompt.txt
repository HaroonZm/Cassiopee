Problem Statement
Snuke has a string
x
of length
N
.
Initially, every character in
x
is
0
.
Snuke can do the following two operations any number of times in any order:
Choose
A
consecutive characters in
x
and replace each of them with
0
.
Choose
B
consecutive characters in
x
and replace each of them with
1
.
Find the number of different strings that
x
can be after Snuke finishes doing operations.
This count can be enormous, so compute it modulo
(10^9+7)
.
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 5000
1 \leq A,B \leq N
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A
B
Output
Print the number of different strings that
x
can be after Snuke finishes doing operations, modulo
(10^9+7)
.
Sample Input 1
4 2 3
Sample Output 1
11
For example,
x
can be
0011
or
1111
in the end, but cannot be
0110
.
Sample Input 2
10 7 2
Sample Output 2
533
Sample Input 3
1000 100 10
Sample Output 3
