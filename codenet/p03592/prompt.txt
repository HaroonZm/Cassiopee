Problem Statement
We have a grid with
N
rows and
M
columns of squares. Initially, all the squares are white.

When a button attached to a row is pressed, the colors of all the squares in that row are inverted; that is, white squares become black and vice versa.
When a button attached to a column is pressed, the colors of all the squares in that column are inverted.
Takahashi can freely press the buttons any number of times. Determine whether he can have exactly
K
black squares in the grid.
