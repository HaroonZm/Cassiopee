Standard Deviation
You have final scores of an examination for
n
students. Calculate standard deviation of the scores
s
1
,
s
2
...
s
n
.
The variance α
2
is defined by
α
2
= (∑
n
i
=1
(s
i
- m)
2
)/n
where
m
is an average of
s
i
.
The standard deviation of the scores is the square root of their variance.
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:
n
s
1
s
2
...
s
n
The input ends with single zero for
n
.
Output
For each dataset, print the standard deviation in a line. The output should not contain an absolute error greater than 10
-4
.
Constraints
n
≤ 1000
0 ≤
s
i
≤ 100
