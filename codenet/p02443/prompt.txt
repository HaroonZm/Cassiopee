Voici un énoncé de problème :

Reverse
Write a program which reads a sequence of integers $A = \{a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}\}$ and reverse specified elements by a list of the following operation:
reverse($b, e$): reverse the order of $a_b, a_{b+1}, ..., a_{e-1}$
Input
The input is given in the following format.
$n$
$a_0 \; a_1 \; ...,\; a_{n-1}$
$q$
$b_1 \; e_1$
$b_2 \; e_2$
:
$b_{q} \; b_{q}$
In the first line, $n$ (the number of elements in $A$) is given. In the second line, $a_i$ (each element in $A$) are given. In the third line, the number of queries $q$ is given and each query is given by two integers $b_i \; e_i$ in the following $q$ lines.
Output
Print all elements of $A$ in a line after performing the given operations. Put a single space character between adjacency elements and a newline at the end of the last element.
Constraints
$1 \leq n \leq 1,000$
$-1,000,000,000 \leq a_i \leq 1,000,000,000$
$1 \leq q \leq 1,000$
$0 \leq b < e \leq n$
