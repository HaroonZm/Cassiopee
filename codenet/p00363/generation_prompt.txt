AHK Education, the educational program section of Aizu Broadcasting Cooperation, broadcasts a children’s workshop program called "Let's Play and Make." Today’s theme is "Make your own flag." A child writes his first initial in the center of their rectangular flag.
Given the flag size and the initial letter to be placed in the center of it, write a program to draw the flag as shown in the figure below.
+-------+
|.......|
|...A...|

+-------+
The figure has "A" in the center of a flag with size 9 (horizontal) × 5 (vertical).
Input
The input is given in the following format.
W

c
The input line provides the flag dimensions
W
(width) and
H
(height) (3 ≤
W,H
≤ 21), and the initial letter
c
. Both
W
and
H
are odd numbers, and
c
is a capital letter.
Output
Draw the flag of specified size with the initial in its center using the following characters: "
+
" for the four corners of the flag, "
-
" for horizontal lines, "
|
" for vertical lines, and "
.
" for the background (except for the initial in the center).

En te basant sur cet énoncé, réécris le code suivant tout en conservant exactement sa fonctionnalité.

```python
W,H,c = input().split()
W = int(W)
H = int(H)

for i in range(H):
    for j in range(W):
        if (i == 0 or i == H-1) and (j == 0 or j == W-1):
            print("+", end="")
        elif i == 0 or i == H-1:
            print("-", end="")
        elif j == 0 or j == W-1:
            print("|", end="")
        elif 2*i == H-1 and 2*j == W-1:
            print(c, end="")
        else:
            print(".", end="")
    print("")
