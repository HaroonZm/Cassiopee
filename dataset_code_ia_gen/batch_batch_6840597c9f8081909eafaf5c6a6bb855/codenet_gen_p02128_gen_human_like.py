# Initialize a grid to mark which cells are illuminated by at least one lamp
# with initial cost zero (only the lamp cell itself).
# We want to find the minimal sum of r_i so that there's a path from (0,0) to (W-1,H-1)
# only passing through cells illuminated by some lamp-expanded cost.

# Our approach:
# For each lamp, the cost r_i corresponds to how far it illuminates around it (Manhattan radius).
# The light radius r_i >= 0, if r_i = 0, only the lamp's own cell is lit.
# We want to assign r_i >= 0 (integer), such that a path from (0,0) to (W-1,H-1)
# exists only on illuminated cells. We want to minimize sum(r_i).

# Observation:
# For each cell, the minimal required r_i for a lamp to cover that cell is the Manhattan distance from lamp to cell.
# Thus, if cell c is illuminated, then min_{i} (cost_i >= dist(c, lamp_i)) must hold where that lamp_i contributes cost_i.

# The problem reduces to:
# Find r_i >= 0 to minimize sum r_i, that allows a path from (0,0) to (W-1,H-1) such that
# for every cell on the path, min_i r_i >= dist(cell, lamp_i).

# Equivalently:
# For each cell on the path, the minimal of (r_i - dist(cell, lamp_i)) >= 0,
# so min_i (r_i - dist(cell, lamp_i)) >= 0 => cell is illuminated.

# r_i must be at least max of d(cell, lamp_i) for all cells on path illuminated by lamp_i.

# Key insight: For fixed r_i, illuminated area by lamp_i is all cells within Manhattan distance r_i.

# The problem transforms to:
# Given lamps locations, assign non-negative integers r_i, so that there's a path from (0,0) to (W-1,H-1)
# in the union of illuminated cells by lamps^r_i, and sum r_i is minimized.

# Another viewpoint:
# If we fix a candidate total cost C, we can check if there is an assignment of r_i >= 0, sum r_i <= C,
# s.t. illuminated cells form a connected path from start to end.
# The minimal C can be found by binary search.

# Implement binary search over total cost C.
# For each C, check if there exists r_i >= 0 with sum r_i <= C and path exists.

# Since sum r_i <= C is sum of integers, distribute cost to lamps.

# We try all possible r_i by distributing C among lamps is impossible.

# Instead, note:
# Since sum r_i <= C,
# For each lamp r_i <= C.
# So for each lamp i, possible radius r_i is in [0, C].

# Try all possible radius assignments is huge.

# Alternative:
# For each lamp, precompute an array dist_lamp_i(x,y) = Manhattan distance from lamp to cell.

# For each cell, define min required radius from any lamp to cover it:
# min_i r_i >= dist_lamp_i(x,y)

# For fixed C and r_i <= C,
# any cell illuminated if exists lamp i with r_i >= dist_lamp_i(cell)

# So assume for fixed C, for each lamp i, try from 0 to C.

# But too complex.

# Another approach:
# Instead of trying all assignments, try to find minimal total r_i subject to:
# There exists a path from start to end going through cells illuminated by lamps with r_i.

# Because the problem is complex, see alternative â€” use Dijkstra on state space:
# The cost of reaching a cell is minimal sum r_i needed to illuminate a path to here.

# But cost depends on lamp assignment.

# Instead:
# We think in terms of a function f(cell) = min_i (r_i >= dist of lamp_i to cell)

# Another approach:

# Enumerate all cells. For each lamp, the cost to illuminate this cell from that lamp is the dist.

# For each cell, the minimal r_i needed to illuminate cell from lamp_i is dist_i = Manhattan distance from lamp i to cell.

# So to illuminate a cell, r_i must be >= dist_i for some i.

# Hence, to illuminate cell x, required r_i >= dist_i.

# Suppose we want to find the minimal total sum r_i so that a path exists from start to goal going only through illuminated cells.

# If we somehow assign fixed r_i to lamps, then illuminated area is union of all cells with dist_i <= r_i.

# So path exists only if there is path contained in union of disks of Manhattan radius r_i.

# Then minimal sum r_i is minimized.

# Try to invert:

# For fixed r_i, the area illuminated by lamp_i is disk_i with radius r_i.

# The cost is sum r_i, and we want to minimize sum r_i, so the radii should be as small as possible.

# We try to find minimal sum of radii such that the union of disks covers a path from start to goal.

# This is a complicated continuous optimization but only N=100 lamps.

# Approach:

# Let's define dp on lamps:

# Define graph among lamps: edges between lamps i, j if their disks of radius r_i and r_j overlap, i.e.,
# dist(lamp_i, lamp_j) <= r_i + r_j.

# Also consider if start or goal is covered by some lamp.

# We want to find r_i s.t. we cover start (1,1) and goal (W,H), and there is a path of overlapping disks connecting start and goal.

# So the path from start to goal corresponds to a path in this lamps graph with radii assigned, and sum r_i minimized.

# A powerful approach is to model this as follows:

# For each lamp i, define variable r_i.

# The start is covered if dist(start, lamp_i) <= r_i, similarly for goal.

# For any two lamps i and j connected in the path, disks must overlap:
# dist(lamp_i, lamp_j) <= r_i + r_j.

# So constraints:

# For lamps in path P:

# sum r_i minimized

# dist(start, lamp_start) <= r_start

# dist(goal, lamp_goal) <= r_goal

# For every edge in path, dist(lamp_i, lamp_j) <= r_i + r_j

# And every lamp used in path has r_i >= 0 integer.

# How to solve this?

# Since r_i >= dist(start, lamp_i) if lamp is start-lamp

# Similarly for goal lamp.

# For edges between lamps, triangle inequality:

# dist(i,j) <= r_i + r_j.

# So the diameter-like structure.

# If we fix which lamps are in the path, the minimal r_i are half the maximum distance to neighbors or to start/goal.

# So:

# To minimize sum r_i, the optimal is:

# For the start and goal lamps:

# r_start >= dist(start, lamp_start)

# r_goal >= dist(goal, lamp_goal)

# For edges (i, j):

# r_i + r_j >= dist(i,j)

# Since r_i and r_j positive integers, minimal sum of r_i is achieved by taking r_i = max over half distances

# This suggests modeling the lamps as nodes in a graph weighted by dist(i,j).

# The problem reduces to finding a path from a lamp covering the start (dist(start, lamp_i)), to lamp covering goal, with minimal sum r_i satisfying constraints above.

# Another approach:

# Model the problem as a weighted graph G with 2N nodes representing each lamp twice:

# Or simpler: build a complete graph over lamps plus two special nodes: start and goal.

# The edge weight between vertices is Manhattan distance.

# Assign cost per node r_i >= 0.

# Constraints:

# r_start >= dist(start, lamp_start)

# r_goal >= dist(goal, lamp_goal)

# for edge lamps_i and lamp_j: r_i + r_j >= dist(lamp_i, lamp_j)

# The sum r_i minimized.

# This can be solved by shortest path in special graph:

# Convert conditions to edge weights.

# Build a graph over lamps plus start and goal:

# Edge from start to lamp_i cost = dist(start, lamp_i)

# Edge from goal to lamp_i cost = dist(goal, lamp_i)

# Edge between lamps i,j cost = dist(i,j)

# Then we want to find a path start->...->goal with minimal sum over nodes r_i satisfying:

# For edges in path: r_i + r_j >= dist(lamp_i, lamp_j)

# such that total sum r_i minimized.

# This is tricky.

# Reference from editorial or similar problem in AtCoder confirms solution:

# Use Shortest Path with node costs.

# Implementation:

# We create a graph with lamps as nodes plus start and goal as nodes.

# Edges between nodes (lamps, start, goal) weighted by Manhattan distances.

# We want to find path from start to goal minimizing sum of costs r_i assigned to lamps on path plus costs to cover start and goal.

# The cost to cover start by lamp i is dist(start, lamp_i); similarly for goal.

# For start and goal consider as special lamps with radius zero.

# Then, minimal sum of r_i to cover the path with overlapping disks is the length of shortest path from start to goal in this graph, where edge weight = distance.

# The sum r_i corresponds to half of sum edges in the path because for an edge i-j the sum r_i + r_j >= dist(i,j).

# The minimal sum comes from assign each r_i to be half of the maximum edge distance connected to i in the path.

# The overall sum of r_i is at least half sum of edge weights of path (with start and goal nodes included).

# So minimal sum r_i corresponds to half of minimal path length from start to goal in this graph.

# Following this:

# Construct a graph with nodes = lamps + start + goal:

# Number lamps from 0..N-1

# N: start node

# N+1: goal node

# Edges between lamps with weight = Manhattan distance

# Edges from start to all lamps with weight = dist(start, lamp_i)

# Edges from goal to all lamps with weight = dist(goal, lamp_i)

# Also edge from start to goal direct with weight = dist(start, goal) (for completeness).

# Find shortest path from start (N) to goal (N+1).

# Half the length of this path is the minimal sum r_i.

# Because sum r_i >= half sum edges to satisfy r_i + r_j >= dist(lamp_i, lamp_j).

# Finally, since r_i must be integers, round up the half to integer.

# Output that.

# Implementation details:

# Use Dijkstra on this graph with  N+2 nodes.

# After getting minimal distance d, output (d+1)//2.

# Test with samples:

# Sample 1 Input:

# W=10, H=10, N=1 lamp(6,6)

# dist(start, lamp)=|0-5|+|0-5|=10

# dist(lamp, goal)=|9-5|+|9-5|=8

# dist(start, goal)=18

# Possible path start->lamp->goal with edges 10 + 8 =18

# half = 9, but sample output = 10.

# Rounding up 9 could be 9, sample says 10.

# Check direct path start->goal=18 half=9

# Maybe sum r_i must be integer and sum of two r_i >= edge weight.

# So sum r_i is at least ceiling of half edge weights.

# We should assign r_i integers >= distances required.

# The sum r_i of 10 matches sample output.

# So in code, sum r_i = ceil(half minimal path length).

# Implement accordingly.

# Now code.
