        # "Given a, find # of (x,y), x,y>=0 and x+y=a such that mysterious operation(x,y) = a"
        # However the examples output are counting pairs from different 'a's, so we
        # must interpret carefully:
        # Given a, find the number of integer pairs (x,y) with x,y >= 0 and inconsequential sum,
        # such that x^3 - y^3 = a.
        # But problem states "ある正整数aについてx,y>=0かつx+y=aとなる整数のペアの個数を求めよ"
        # So the sum x + y = a is fixed, and we count that pair only if x^3 - y^3 = a holds.
        # But examples like input=19 output=1 from pair (5,4):
        # 5+4=9 != 19, x^3 - y^3=125 - 64=61 != 19
        # So match problem statement carefully:
        # The problem wants the number of pairs (x,y) with x,y>=0 and x + y = a,
        # such that the strange operator x + y (mysterious operator) produces a certain value.
        # In other words, the mysterious operator applied to x and y yields some number.
        # The question is about counting pairs with given a (input) matching a certain value.
        # The problem states to count pairs (x,y), x,y >= 0, x + y = a, such that the mysterious operator applied to (x,y) yields a certain mysterious sum.

        # However, input/output examples clarify that for input a, output is the # of pairs (x,y),
        # with x,y >=0, and x+y = a where mysterious operator returns a certain value linked to the input.

        # The mysterious operator is: for input (x,y), output = x^3 - y^3 (deduced from the problem)
        # Goal: For input a, count number of pairs (x,y), x,y>=0, x+y = a, such that x^3 - y^3 = a.

        # So we want pairs x,y>=0, x+y=a, with x^3 - y^3 = a.
        # For each x in [0,a], y = a - x, test if x^3 - y^3 = a.

        # But a can be up to 10^9, so brute force is not feasible (up to 10^9 iterations).

        # We try to solve the equation:
        # x + y = a
        # x^3 - y^3 = a

        # Let y = a - x
        # Then:
        # x^3 - (a - x)^3 = a
        # x^3 - (a^3 - 3a^2 x + 3a x^2 - x^3) = a
        # x^3 - a^3 + 3 a^2 x - 3 a x^2 + x^3 = a
        # 2 x^3 - 3 a x^2 + 3 a^2 x - a^3 = a
        # Rearrange:
        # 2 x^3 - 3 a x^2 + 3 a^2 x - (a^3 + a) = 0

        # Let polynomial f(x) = 2 x^3 - 3 a x^2 + 3 a^2 x - (a^3 + a) = 0

        # We want integer roots x in [0,a].

        # Check integer roots using Rational Root Theorem:

        # Candidates divide constant term (a^3 + a) which can be huge.

        # Instead, try x in range close to a or 0: check integer roots heuristically.

        # Since x,y ≥0 and x+y = a, x ∈ [0,a]

        # We will perform a binary search approach or iterative search with pruning.

        # Another idea: (x,y) = (n, a-n)
        # Compute f(n) and check zero.

        # To optimize, test only n where n^3 - (a-n)^3 = a.

        pairs = []
        a = target

        # Because function f(n) over n in [0,a] is cubic with known shape, evaluate at bounds:
        # f(0) = 0^3 - (a)^3 = -a^3 < a for positive a
        # x^3 - (a - x)^3 is increasing with x (since derivative positive)
        # So do binary search to find roots.

        # However, since input max 10^9, checking all is still too much.

        # Instead, check all x in [0,a] where x^3 - (a-x)^3 = a,
        # but this is at most a, so too expensive.

        # We try to test x candidates derived from solving x^3 - (a - x)^3 = a.

        # Let's try to solve symbolically for x:

        # Let k = a

        # Rewrite as: x^3 - (k - x)^3 = k

        # x^3 - (k^3 - 3k^2 x + 3k x^2 - x^3) = k

        # x^3 - k^3 + 3 k^2 x - 3 k x^2 + x^3 = k

        # 2 x^3 - 3 k x^2 + 3 k^2 x - k^3 - k = 0

        # Let’s try integer candidates dividing k^3 + k

        # Note that if x is root, so is y = k - x.

        # We'll compute all divisors d of k^3 + k up to cube root to test candidates.

        # But too big to do fully.

        # Hint from examples: output is small numbers like 0,1,2,4...

        # So the count is small. We can test only candidates near k/2 (where difference is small).

        # We test x in some range around k/2 +- 1000 to cover small possibilities.

        start = max(0, a // 2 - limit)
        end = min(a, a // 2 + limit)
