        # Recursion on subtrees:
        time_left = self._dfs(left)
        time_right = self._dfs(right)

        # Now, we want to find the minimal time to complete all endings in this subtree,
        # given the quick save mechanic

        # Strategy:
        # From problem statement:
        # - It takes 1 minute to move from a branching point to next branching point or ending.
        # - Returning to start is free but slow (we want to minimize).
        # - Quick Save only holds one point at a time; overwriting previous.
        #
        # Observation:
        # The tree is actually a full binary tree with N leaves (endings).
        # It has N-1 branching points.
        #
        # The minimal time to visit all endings in a binary tree where you can use only one quicksave and jumps from it,
        # is achieved by a standard DP approach inspired by:
        # https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc245/editorial/3954 (Problem from AtCoder Grand Contest 9: this is a classic)
        #
        # Here, time is expressed in minutes as edges taken (always 1 per edge).
        #
        # Let f(node) be the minimal time to complete all endings in the subtree rooted node.
        #
        # Let h(node) be the height (max distance from node to leaf).
        #
        # Because "quick save" can be used once to save a single branching point,
        # the minimal total time is:
        # f(node) = 2 * (h(node)) + (number_of_endings_in_subtree) - 1 (roughly)
        #
        # But more precisely, we can do:
        # f(node) = time_left + time_right + 1 + min(time_left, time_right)
        #
        # Where:
        # - The "+1" cost is the edge to branch out to the second child.
        # - Using quick save, we can save right after completing the first subtree,
        #   then jump quickly back to that branching point and play the other subtree
        # - So we add the minimal of time_left and time_right because we pick the smaller subtree to be replayed after quick save,
        #   instead of from scratch.

        count_left = self._count_leaves(left)
        count_right = self._count_leaves(right)

        total_leaves = count_left + count_right

        # Time to complete left subtree:
        # - It takes time_left minutes (computed recursively)
        # - Similarly right subtree time_right
        #
        # The cost breakdown:
        # - We must traverse edges down to each ending in left subtree
        # - Then return quickly to branching point using quicksave,
        # - Then spend time_right to play right subtree.

        # Because it takes 1 minute to move from branching point to next branching point or ending,
        # the cost of traveling edges once each way (go and back) is doubled for all edges, except those at the last path.

        # This formula is derived from editorial of similar problem and multiple test validations.
