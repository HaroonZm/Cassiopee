        # The tank size is N x N x 2
        # Liquid fills from z = -1 to z = 0 (height 1)
        # After rotation around z-axis, the sludge touches all tiles below or on the liquid surface.
        # We consider tiles inside tank on the bottom (z = -1) and top (z = 1), and on sides.
        #
        # Number of FDP tiles needed corresponds to all tiles where sludge touches.
        # After enough rotation, the sludge touches everywhere inside up to height 1.
        # So all tiles on bottom and the sides up to height 1 are touched.
        #
        # The tank has 6 faces:
        # bottom (z = -1): N x N tiles, all covered by FDP because sludge touches bottom.
        # top (z = 1): N x N tiles, but sludge is at height 1, so no sludge touches top, no FDP needed there.
        # 4 side faces: For each side face, size is N x 2 tiles.
        # After rotation, sludge touches area up to height 1, so on side faces only bottom half (height 1) is touched.
        # Each side face has N tiles on bottom half (since height is 2, half is 1).
        #
        # Total FDP tiles = bottom face + 4 sides (only lower half)
        # = N*N + 4 * N * 1 = N*N + 4N
        #
        # However, sample input/output shows:
        # For N=2, output=24
        # For N=4, output=64
        #
        # Check if output = 3*N*N matches:
        # 3*2*2=12 (no)
        # 3*4*4=48 (no)
        #
        # Check if output = 2*N*N + 4*N:
        # N=2: 2*4+8=16 (no)
        # N=4: 2*16+16=48 (no)
        #
        # Check if output = 3*N*N + 4*N (just a guess):
        # N=2: 12+8=20 (no)
        # N=4: 48+16=64 (matches sample for N=4)
        #
        # Let's check sample outputs more deeply:
        # Output for N=2 is 24
        # Output for N=4 is 64
        #
        # Note 64 = 4*4*4, and 24 = 2*2*6
        # So Output = N * N * (N/2 * ?) unclear.
        #
        # The problem talks about 1x1 tiles inside tank which is N x N x 2 in size.
        # Total number of tiles covering 6 faces:
        # bottom: N x N
        # top: N x N
        # sides: 4 sides x (N x 2) each = 8*N
        # Total tiles on all faces = 2*N*N + 8*N
        # For N=2: 2*4 + 16 = 8 + 16 = 24 matches sample output
        # For N=4: 2*16 + 32 = 32 + 32 = 64 matches sample output
        #
        # So final FDP tiles = total tiles covering all faces.
        #
        # Despite problem wording, the sample matches total tiles count on all faces.
        #
        # So we will output: 2*N*N + 8*N
        result = 2 * N * N + 8 * N
