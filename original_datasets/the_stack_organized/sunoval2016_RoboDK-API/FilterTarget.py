# This script shows how to filter an existing target as a pose
# This is useful for a robot that has been calibrated and we need to get the filtered pose
# Important: It is assumed that the robot will reach the pose with the calculated configuration

# Define the TCP

# Very important for SolveFK and SolveIK (Forward/Inverse kinematics)

# Define a nominal target in the joint space:

# Calculate the nominal robot position for the joint target:
# robot flange with respect to the robot base (4x4 pose)
pose_rob = robot.SolveFK(joints)

# Calculate pose_target: the TCP with respect to the reference frame

# robot.setJoints(joints)
